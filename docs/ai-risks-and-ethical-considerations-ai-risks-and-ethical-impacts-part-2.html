            <p>Generative models learn from existing works, including copyrighted material. Their outputs can sometimes mimic an artist&#x27;s style or content too closely, creating legal and ethical conflicts.</p>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> (1) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/meta-ai-local-authors-1.7502766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Meta used pirated books</a> to train some of its AI models. (2) A music class uses an AI tool that creates songs that sound almost identical to those of a living artist.</p>

            <p>Generative AI is changing the job market. It can automate some tasks, assist with others, and shift the demand for certain skills, especially for entry-level roles.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A marketing firm reduces its need for copywriters after adopting an AI-assisted writing tool, affecting entry level jobs.</p>

            <p>Training and running large AI models uses a lot of energy and water. The hardware itself relies on global supply chains that can have their own environmental and social risks.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> An AI company builds a large data center which requires a large amount of electricity and water (for cooling). The local community experiences rolling brownouts and minimal water pressure.</p>

            <p>A few large companies control most of the computing power, data, and models for AI. This concentration of power can limit innovation, drive up prices, and lock users into one ecosystem.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A vendor bundles an AI suite that forces a school to use one specific cloud provider and a closed set of models.</p>

            <p>Interactions with AI can feel as good as the real thing. AI can act like a therapist, a friend, or an antagonist but it is not actually any of those things. It can also produce polished work that lets students skip the hard parts of learning. This replaces moments of growth, creativity, and struggle with a &quot;good enough&quot; substitute.</p>

            <p><strong>Examples: </strong> (1) A user has enjoyable interactions with a chatbot and feels like he/she has developed a relationship with it. When the chatbot is updated to a newer version, the user feels like they have lost a friend. (2) A student submits an AI-written reflection, missing the chance to develop their own voice, judgment, and ideas.</p>

            <p>AI can be used to create and spread abusive content. This includes non-consensual deepfakes and targeted harassment. It can also expose minors to harmful material.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A student’s face is put into a sexualized deepfake image by classmates, which then spreads rapidly online.</p>

            <h5><i></i>Connecting the Dots</h5>

            <p>These risks are not separate problems. They are an interconnected web of challenges. Seeing the links between them is key to understanding AI safety.Here are a few examples:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>A few companies with <strong>Monopoly Power</strong> can control most AI models. This can worsen <strong>Bias &amp; Fairness</strong> issues by limiting diverse options and hurt <strong>Accountability</strong> because closed systems are hard to audit.</li>
            	<li>Poor <strong>Data Security</strong> leads to breaches. This enables <strong>Security Threats</strong> like personalized phishing scams, which then fuel <strong>Information Harms</strong> by making fake content more believable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your Turn: What other connections can you find? Think about how a lack of <strong>Transparency</strong> might affect <strong>Simulated Reality</strong> in learning. How could a focus on the <strong>Environment</strong> change which models get built? Exploring these connections is a powerful way to build your understanding of the negative impacts of generative AI.</p>
