              Navigate with Wisdom: You're in Control
            </h3>
            <p>
              Having explored the potential and pitfalls of Generative AI, the most important takeaway is this:
              <strong>
                you are the pilot, not a passenger.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              AI is a powerful tool, but like any tool, its true value, effectiveness, and ethical application depend entirely on the human user. It's your critical engagement, your informed judgment, your thoughtful questions, and your diligent oversight that will determine whether AI augments your abilities and leads to positive outcomes, or becomes a source of error and ethical missteps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, the goal is for AI to
              <em>
                augment
              </em>
              your intelligence and creativity, not replace your critical thinking. You decide the destination, you chart the course, and you remain in command.

                Key Principles for Smart AI Use (Recap & Action)
              </h3>
              <p>
                To help you navigate effectively, keep these core principles at the forefront of your mind whenever you engage with AI:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Always Verify, Never Blindly Trust:
                  </strong>
                  AI outputs are starting points; always cross-reference with reliable sources as AI can confidently "hallucinate."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Question Everything:
                  </strong>
                  Critically examine AI responses for sense, bias, omissions, and underlying assumptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Use Responsibly & Ethically:
                  </strong>
                  Respect intellectual property, cite AI appropriately, and avoid uses that harm or compromise integrity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Maintain Your Agency:
                  </strong>
                  Use AI to assist, not replace, your own critical thinking and core intellectual work to keep your skills sharp
                </li>
              </ul>
