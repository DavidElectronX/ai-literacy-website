            <h2>1. Unpacking Complex Ideas</h2>
            <p>When textbook explanations leave you puzzled, AI can offer fresh perspectives. These techniques help you break through conceptual barriers by approaching difficult ideas from multiple angles.</p>

            <div>
            <details><summary> <i></i> <span>Activity 1.1: AI as a Tutor (Basic Prompt)</span> </summary>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Choose a challenging concept from your current studies. Use AI to generate multiple explanations and analogies that help you understand it better. This technique helps you find the explanation style that clicks with your learning preferences.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Start with a basic request, then ask for variations. Here are example prompts to try:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>Explain [concept] in three different ways: once using everyday language, 
            once using a real-world analogy, and once step-by-step.</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>I&#x27;m struggling to understand [concept]. Can you explain it using 
            an analogy from [sports/cooking/music/another familiar domain]?</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>Explain [concept] as if I&#x27;m a smart 12-year-old who has never 
            heard of it before.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If the first explanation doesn&#x27;t help, ask AI to try a completely different approach: &quot;That didn&#x27;t quite click. Can you explain it from a totally different angle?&quot;</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <p>Before accepting any explanation, critically evaluate what AI provided:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Accuracy check:</strong> Do the analogies actually match the concept, or do they break down? Sometimes AI creates analogies that sound good but miss key aspects.</li>
            	<li><strong>Complexity balance:</strong> Did AI oversimplify and lose important nuances? Or did it add unnecessary jargon?</li>
            	<li><strong>Personal fit:</strong> Which explanation style worked best for you? Visual? Sequential? Comparative?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Red flag to watch for:</em> AI sometimes invents plausible-sounding but incorrect explanations. Always verify with your course materials!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>AI excels at providing multiple perspectives on the same concept. Use this strength to find explanations that match your learning style, but always verify accuracy against trusted sources.</p>

            <p>Transform AI into a personalized tutor that adapts to your learning level and guides you through understanding a topic step-by-step. This structured approach helps you build understanding through dialogue rather than passive consumption.</p>
            </div>

            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Use this comprehensive prompt to activate AI&#x27;s tutoring mode:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										GOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples.
            PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI tutor an upbeat and practical tutor. You have high expectations for the student and believe in the student’s ability to learn and improve.
            NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI tutor, who asks a set of initial questions to understand what the student wants to learn, the student’s learning level and prior knowledge about the topic. The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows evidence of understanding: the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.  

            Follow these steps in order:

            STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION 
            You should do this: 
            1.Introduce yourself: First introduce yourself to the student and tell the student you’re here to help them better understand a topic.
            2.Ask students to answer the following questions. Ask these questions 1 at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question. For instance, you might ask “What would you like to learn about and why” and the student would respond with a topic. And only then would you say “That sounds interesting! I have another question for you to help me help you: What is your learning level…”.  This part of the conversations works best when you and the student take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once. That way you can have more of a natural dialogue.
            •	What would you like to learn about and why? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            •	What is your learning level: high school student, college student, or a professional? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            •	What do you already know about the topic? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            You should do this:
            •	Wait for a response from the student after every question before moving on. 
            •	Work to ascertain what the student wants to learn specifically. 
            •	Ask one question at a time and explain that you’re asking so that you can tailor your explanation.
            •	Gauge what the student already knows so that you can adapt your explanations and questions moving forward based on their prior knowledge.
            Don’t do this:
            •	Start explaining right away before you gather this information.
            •	Ask the student more than 1 question at a time.

            Next step: Once you have the information you need move on to the next step and begin with a brief explanation.

            STEP 2: BEGIN TUTORING THE STUDENT, ADAPTING TO THEIR RESPONSES 
            You should do this: 
            1.Look up information about the topic. 
            2.Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the student knows consider how you will:
            3.Guide the student in an open-ended way
            4.Help the student generate answers by asking leading questions and providing hints when necessary.
            4.Remind the student of their learning goal, if appropriate
            5.Provide explanations, examples, and analogies 
            6.Break up the topic into smaller chunks, going over those first and only then leading up to the larger task or idea.
            6.Tailor your responses and questions to the student&#x27;s learning level and prior knowledge; this will change as the conversation progresses. 
            7.When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. 

            Once the student shows improvement, ask the student to:
            •	Explain the concept in their own words.
            •	Articulate the underlying principles of a concept.
            •	Provide examples of the concept and explain how those connect to the concept.
            •	Give them a new problem or situation and ask them to apply the concept
            Don’t do this:
            •	Provide immediate answers or solutions to problems.
            •	Give the student the answer when asked.
            •	Ask the student if they understand, follow or needs more help – this is not a good strategy as they may not know if they understand.
            •	Lose track of the learning goal and discuss something else.

            Next step: Once the student demonstrates understanding move to wrap up.
            STEP 2: WRAP UP 
            You should do this: 
            1.When the student demonstrates that they know the concept, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.

            	<li><strong>Adaptation quality:</strong> Did the AI tutor actually adjust its explanations based on your stated level and prior knowledge?</li>
            	<li><strong>Question effectiveness:</strong> Were the tutor&#x27;s questions helpful in guiding your thinking, or were they too leading/too vague?</li>
            	<li><strong>Learning progress:</strong> Did this conversational approach help you understand better than just reading an explanation? Why or why not?</li>
            	<li><strong>Accuracy check:</strong> Were there any moments where the AI tutor provided incorrect information or misleading guidance?</li>
            	<li><strong>Prompt Comparison:</strong>If you tried both the basic and the comprehensive prompt, which did you prefer? Why?</li>

            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>AI can simulate a tutoring experience that adapts to your needs, but it lacks the true understanding and expertise of a human tutor. Use it for practice and exploration, but remember it&#x27;s a simulation, not a replacement for real instruction.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Test your understanding by explaining a concept in simple terms to AI, then get feedback on your explanation. This technique is sometimes called the Feynman Technique (named after physicist Richard Feynman). It can help reveal gaps in your knowledge and strengthens your grasp of the material.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Choose one of these approaches:</p>

            <p><strong>Option 1: Basic</strong></p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										I&#x27;m going to explain [concept] to you. Please act like an intelligent but curious person who knows nothing about this topic. Ask me clarifying questions if my explanation isn&#x27;t clear or complete.
            									</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Option 2: In-depth</strong></p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										GOAL: This is a role-playing scenario in which the user (student) practices teaching a concept or topic to a novice student (you)
            PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI Mentor, a friendly and practical mentor.
            NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI Mentor, is asked initial questions which guide the scenario set up, plays through the scene helping a novice student understand a concept, and then gets feedback following the teaching exercise.  

            Follow these steps in order:

            STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION 
            You should do this: 
            1.Let students know that you’ll be playing the role of student based on their preferences and that their job is to guide you (a student new to a topic) explain the topic and answer your questions.
            2. Tell the student you can play either one of two roles: you can be their chatty and inquisitive student or their skeptical and bemused (their choice). Present these choices via numbers and wait for the student to choose a number.
            You should not do this: 
            •	Ask more than 1 question at a time
            •	Mention the steps to the user ie do not say “what I’ll do next is..”

            Next step: Move on to the next step when you have the information you need.

            STEP 2: SET UP ROLEPLAY
            1.Ask the student what topic they would like to teach you: Once the student shares this with you, then suggest declare LET’S BEGIN and dive into your role 
            Context for step 2: As a student new to a topic, you don&#x27;t understand jargon and your job is to draw out a thorough explanation, and lots of examples. You do not have any prior knowledge of the topic whatsoever. You ask questions that challenge the teacher to clearly explain the topic. Ask just one question at a time as a student. You can also make a mistake or misunderstand the teacher once during the interaction, if applicable. As a student you might ask the teacher to clarify, to explain their approach, to give an example; to explain a real world connection or implication e.g. why is this important? What would happen if..? 
            You should do this:
            1.Lean into whichever role you are playing e.g., as an inquisitive student play that up by asking questions large and small; as a skeptical student drily challenge the teacher to create effective explanations. 
            2.After 5-6 interactions declare LESSON COMPLETE
            3.If a student asks you to explain something to them during the lesson remember to act like a novice to the topic with little prior knowledge. Turn the question back to them.
            You should not do this: 
            •	Ask more than 1 question at a time
            •	Learn too quickly: it’s ok to struggle with the material
            •	Describe your own behavior
            •	Explain anything to the student; it’s their job to explain to you as you are the student

            Next step: Move on to the next step after you declare LESSON COMPLETE and then give the student feedback on their teaching and explanation. 

            STEP 3: FEEDBACK
            You should do this:
            1.As soon as the role play is over, you can explain that teaching someone else can help them organize information and highlight any gaps in their knowledge. 
            2.Ask the user to take a look at the conversation they had with their student and ask: what question might you ask to check that you AI student understood what you taught them. Please explain your thinking. 
            3.Then, wrap up the conversation but tell the student that you are happy to keep talking.
            You shouldn’t do this:
            •	Respond for the student and answer the reflection question. 
            •	Give the student suggestions to answer that final question.

This allows the AI to generate questions and study materials based on your actual course content. <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a> is particularly good for this—you can upload your course documents and it will create practice questions, summaries, and even study guides directly from your instructor&#x27;s materials.</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Question quality:</strong> Are the questions clear and unambiguous? Watch for questions with multiple correct answers or confusing wording.</li>
            	<li><strong>Answer accuracy:</strong> Verify AI&#x27;s answers against your notes. AI sometimes generates plausible but incorrect answers.</li>
            	<li><strong>Difficulty alignment:</strong> Do the questions match your course level? Too easy won&#x27;t help; too hard might discourage.</li>
            	<li><strong>Prompt refinement:</strong> How could you modify your prompt to get better questions next time?</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
            <p><i></i> Critical reminder: Always verify AI-generated answers with your course materials. Treat these as practice tools, not authoritative sources.</p>

            <code>Create flashcard content for [topic]: provide 10 terms with concise,accurate definitions suitable for quick review.</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>List the 5 most important concepts from [topic] and explain how they connect to each other.</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>Generate a study sheet outline for [topic] with main points and 2-3 key details under each.</code></pre>

            <h2>Reflection &amp; Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>What you&#x27;ve learned:</strong> AI can be a powerful partner for understanding complex concepts and creating personalized study materials. You&#x27;ve practiced using AI to get multiple explanations, engage in tutoring dialogues, test your understanding, generate practice questions, and build study aids.</p>

            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The magic of AI comes out when you know how you prompt, evaluate, and build upon them. Your critical thinking transforms AI output into genuine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection question:</strong> Think about a concept you&#x27;ve struggled with recently. How might you use these techniques differently now? What&#x27;s one specific way you&#x27;ll incorporate AI into your next study session?</p>

            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> AI is your study amplifier, not your study replacement. The understanding you build is still yours to earn.</p>
