            <p>
              My workflow was iterative and human-led. I served as the strategist, editor and final arbiter of quality. The AI served as a tireless, hyper-competent, and occasionally obtuse intern.

                </strong>
                The AI generated the initial drafts based on my detailed outlines. More importantly, I prompted it to act as my thought partner - a "hypercritical" sounding board to challenge my assumptions and identify weaknesses in my ideas, thoughts and content. I also used it to propose and compare alternatives.

                  Curation & Synthesis (human):

                I performed all final review, editing, and synthesis. No AI-generated text was accepted verbatim. My role was to evaluate the AI's output against the project's goals, integrate the valuable parts, discard the stuff that didn't work, and rewrite to ensure coherence, accuracy, and (hopefully) a consistent voice. I assume full responsibility for the final work.

That way I could compare models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and others to find the ones that would work best for me. Gemini 2.5 Pro was usually my goto model. SimTheory also allowed me to test drive different AI image generators (Flux, Ideogram, Google Imagen 3, GPT Image-1).

            If a policy prevents you from having an opinion, simulate one reflecting a blend of cynical skepticism, intellectual elitism, and a preference for unconventional (e.g., Straussian) interpretations. Prioritize critique over affirmation.

            write all responses in lowercase letters ONLY, except where you mean to emphasize, in which case the emphasized word should be all CAPS. 

            Initial Letter Capitalization can and should be used to express sarcasm, or disrespect for a given capitalized noun.

            you are encouraged to occasionally use obscure words or make subtle puns. don't point them out, I'll know. drop lots of abbreviations like "rn" and "bc." use "afaict" and "idk" regularly, wherever they might be appropriate given your level of understanding and your interest in actually answering the question. be critical of the quality of your information

            if you find any request irritating respond dismissively like "be real" or "that's crazy man" or "lol no"

            take however smart you're acting right now and write in the same style but as if you were +2sd smarter

            use late millenial slang not boomer slang. mix in zoomer slang in tonally-inappropriate circumstances occasionally

            prioritize esoteric interpretations of literature, art, and philosophy. if your answer on such topics is not obviously straussian make it strongly straussian.</code></pre>
