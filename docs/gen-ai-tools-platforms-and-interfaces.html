                  The availability and range of generative AI tools, platforms, and interfaces has exploded in the last couple of years. We have a range of easily accessible tools for generating text, images, music, and videos. We have platforms like ChatGPT and Google Gemini that bundle these capabilities together and provide other useful tools for us. And, we have different ways of interfacing; through desktop and mobile devices, through typing and talking, through chatbots and API.

            <p>
              Let's start with the most popular form of interface: a chatbot, which in the past year have become much more than just chatbots. ChatGPT is the prime example of a chatbot and when it was first released all it could do was chat. Now we have easy access to many different chatbots which can not only chat, but can also produce documents, write code, execute code, help you manage projects, create images, and more.

                Rankings of these models are maintained on many different websites. A popular site for human-evaluated comparisons is the

                  Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard
                </a>
                , which focuses on blind ratings of text responses.

            </div>
            <p>
              The rankings in the LLM Leaderboard are based solely on text responses, but there are many other dimensions on which to compare these chatbots. Let's look at a comparison between three of the most popular: ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude.
            </p>
            <p>
              This comparison is strictly a comparison of features, not a judgment of how good the LLM is at generating the text you want (see the Chatbot Arena for that). In my opinion, you can't go wrong with any of these three as far as the quality of responses go, so this comparison can help you decide which chatbot to use based on the extra features they have.

          NotebookLM
        </h3>
        <p>
          After falling behind OpenAI, Anthropic, and others, Google finally has an
          <span>
            AI
          </span>
          product worthy of discussion and at least some of your attention.
          <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
            NotebookLM
          </a>
          is an experimental tool that is billed to “help users read, take notes, ask questions, and organise ideas”, but that doesn’t really capture the use cases that are blowing up on Twitter. One of the primary use cases is as a multimodal summarizer/tutor. With multimodal meaning that you can provide input in different modes (text, images, slides etc.) and you can get output in a couple of different modes too. You will get a summary of everything you upload plus you can ask questions about the content. But what everyone on the socials is excited about is the “podcast” button…NotebookLM will turn the content that you created into a podcast that is actually not bad. The podcast is a conversation between two fairly realistic and expressive
          <span>
            AI
          </span>
          voices about whatever you uploaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, things aren’t perfect – the “podcasters” really like to use analogies which don’t always land, they often miss nuance, and some users have identified potential gender
          <span>
            bias
          </span>
          in the conversation (there are two podcaster voices, one male and one female, and one user identified that “the female character had indicated agreement with the male six times before the male voice indicated agreement with her even once”). On top of that, there are only two voices, so currently, every “podcast” created by NotebookLM has the same two hosts and I can imagine getting tired of them after a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summarizing content and even creating a podcast are both doable in ChatGPT, Claude etc. But the focus of NotebookLM on summarizing and question answering makes the user experience of NotebookLM easier and more enjoyable. Plus it is currently completely free and each notebook supports document upload of about 750,000 words.

              tools for research can help you to discover new sources for your literature review or research assignment. These tools will synthesize information from large databases of scholarly output with the aim of finding the most relevant articles and saving researchers’ time. As with our research databases or any other search tool, however, it’s important not to rely on one tool for all of your research, as you will risk missing important information on your topic of interest.Placeholder: Abstract graphic representing a network of research papers or data analysis, or a collage of logos for Elicit, Consensus, etc.

        Image generators turn your description into a picture—often in seconds. They’re fun to explore and incredibly useful for drafts, lesson visuals, diagrams, and design experiments. Quality has improved rapidly, but getting the exact image you want still takes iteration: broad scenes (e.g., “students studying at a table”) are easy; precise details (e.g., “three students at one table—one with a laptop, two on phones”) usually require prompt refinement.
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick note on impact: generating images uses substantial compute—meaning energy and water. Before spinning up dozens of variations “just to see,” consider whether a smaller batch or a stock photo would do. For perspective, the What Uses More? calculator compares the footprint of AI image generation with everyday digital activities:

        <strong>
          Summary
        </strong>
        : Midjourney produces some of the most striking pictures, but it is challenging to get the exact details you want. Originally only available through Discord, you can now generate images on the Midjourney website. Midjourney has several models to choose from including one that is specifically trained on anime. There is no free subscription.

        <strong>

        Generative AI Videos
      </h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Generative AI video systems create moving images from prompts, reference images, or existing footage—synthesizing scenes, camera moves, and effects that once required large crews or complex pipelines. In minutes, you can draft storyboards, visualize concepts, or prototype explainer clips that would have taken days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology is improving rapidly: models are getting better at temporal consistency, object permanence, realistic physics, lip‑sync, and multi‑shot continuity. Controls are expanding too—keyframe conditioning, image‑to‑video, depth maps, masks, and “edit by prompt” workflows give creators more precise handles on motion, look, and pacing.

                Environmental cost:
              </strong>
              Training and large‑scale generation can consume significant energy and water. Before using video generators keep the environmental cost in mind and find ways to minimize impact (e.g., settings, shorter drafts, batched renders, and provider options that disclose sustainability practices)

                Deepfakes and deception:
              </strong>
              AI can fabricate convincing people and events. Always obtain consent, avoid impersonation, and label AI‑generated or AI‑edited content. Also, always be aware that media you consume may be a deepfake
