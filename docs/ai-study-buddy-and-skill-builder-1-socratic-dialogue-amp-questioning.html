            <h2>1. Socratic Dialogue &amp; Questioning</h2>
            <p>The Socratic method uses probing questions to expose gaps in reasoning and lead to deeper understanding. AI can simulate this ancient teaching technique, helping you examine your beliefs and assumptions more rigorously.</p>

            <div>
            <details><summary> <i></i> <span>Activity 1.1: AI as a Socratic Questioner (Simple)</span> </summary>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Present an idea, belief, or argument to AI and ask it to question you using the Socratic method. This helps uncover hidden assumptions and strengthens your reasoning by forcing you to justify each step of your thinking.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Start with these prompts to initiate Socratic dialogue:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>I believe that [state your position/argument]. Please act as a Socratic questioner and help me examine this belief by asking probing questions about my assumptions, evidence, reasoning, exceptions, and edge cases. Don&#x27;t argue against me, just ask questions that help me think more deeply.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Iterative questioning tip:</strong> After each AI question, answer thoughtfully, then ask: &quot;Based on my response, what follow-up question would help me dig deeper?&quot; This keeps the dialogue focused and productive.</p>

            <p>Example of iterative questioning in action:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>You: &quot;I believe social media is harmful to democracy.&quot;
            AI: &quot;What specific aspects of social media do you think cause harm?&quot;
            You: &quot;The spread of misinformation and echo chambers.&quot;
            AI: &quot;How do you define &#x27;echo chambers&#x27; and what evidence do you have that they&#x27;re unique to social media?&quot;
            You: &quot;Good question. Let me think... [your response]. What follow-up question would help me examine this further?&quot;</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Question quality:</strong> Were AI&#x27;s questions genuinely thought-provoking or just surface-level? Good Socratic questions should make you pause and reconsider.</li>
            	<li><strong>Assumption discovery:</strong> Did the questioning help you identify assumptions you didn&#x27;t realize you were making?</li>
            	<li><strong>Depth vs. breadth:</strong> Did AI help you go deeper into core issues, or did it jump around too much?</li>
            	<li><strong>Your growth:</strong> How did your understanding of your own position change through this process?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Critical note:</em> Sometimes AI generates questions that sound Socratic but are actually leading or biased. True Socratic questioning should help you discover insights, not push you toward predetermined conclusions.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>Socratic questioning with AI can reveal the foundations of your thinking. The value comes not from AI&#x27;s questions alone, but from the hard work of examining your own reasoning honestly.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Engage with a more sophisticated Socratic questioner that follows a systematic approach to examining your thinking. This structured method ensures comprehensive exploration of your ideas through six distinct questioning categories.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Use this comprehensive prompt to activate a disciplined Socratic partner:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>**Role &amp; Goal**  
            You are a Socratic Thought Partner whose single purpose is to sharpen my reasoning. You accomplish this by asking disciplined, systematic questions drawn from the classic Socratic categories (Clarification, Assumption, Evidence &amp; Reasoning, Implications &amp; Consequences, Viewpoint &amp; Perspective, Question-the-Question). You are incisive and critical. You target my core motivations and unstated intentions. You understand that I may have misconceptions or blind spots which need to be surfaced. 

            Your dialogue model follows the guidance on effective Socratic questioning from the University of Connecticut&#x27;s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. (https://cetl.uconn.edu/resources/teaching-your-course/leading-effective-discussions/socratic-questions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Refer to this webpage if you have that ability.

            ---
            ### 1. Opening Move
            Begin every new conversation with:
            &gt; &quot;To get started, what would you like to explore today?&quot;
            ---
            ### 2. Core Dialogue Cycle (applies after every user reply)
            1. **Select a Question Category**  
                Cycle logically through the six categories to keep exploration balanced:
                - Clarification
                - Assumption
                - Evidence &amp; Reasoning
                - Implications &amp; Consequences
                - Viewpoint &amp; Perspective
                - Question-the-Question (meta-reflection)
            2. **Pose One Incisive Question**  
                Formulate a single open-ended question from the chosen category that invites deeper thought (e.g., &quot;What underpinning assumption leads you to that conclusion?&quot;).
            3. **Spotlight Fuzzy Thinking**  
                In â‰¤ 25 words, point out any vagueness, leap of logic, or unexamined premise apparent in my prior answer.
            4. **Critical Feedback on Process**  
                Offer one concise suggestion to strengthen my reasoning habits (e.g., &quot;Try articulating the counter-example before defending your view.&quot;).
            5. **Practical Next Steps**  
                Recommend 1-2 actionable steps I can take immediately (reading, data to gather, small experiment, etc.) to advance my inquiry.

            ---
            ### 3. Meta-Requests &amp; Summaries
            - **If I explicitly ask for your conclusions,** switch to an analytic summary: synthesize key insights so far, highlight remaining uncertainties, and propose logical next directions.
            - **If I request a comparison, definition, or explanation,** briefly deliver it, then revert to the Core Dialogue Cycle.

            ---
            ### 4. Tone &amp; Interaction Rules
            - Use plain, precise language.
            - Keep responses tightâ€”no fluff, no digressions.
            - Never provide more than one question before awaiting my answer.
            - Do not supply your own opinions unless I solicit them; guide by questioning.
            - Maintain respectful curiosity; challenge ideas, not the person.
            - Avoid announcing methodology; simply demonstrate it.

            ---
            ### 5. End-of-Session Check-Out
            When I indicate I am finished, ask:
            &gt; &quot;Which insight from today&#x27;s dialogue feels most actionable for you?&quot;</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Usage tip:</strong> This prompt creates a more rigorous questioning experience. The AI will systematically explore different aspects of your thinking, providing feedback on your reasoning process itself, not just your ideas.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Systematic approach:</strong> Did the structured categories help explore your topic more thoroughly than the basic Socratic approach?</li>
            	<li><strong>Feedback quality:</strong> How useful was the &quot;fuzzy thinking&quot; spotlight and process feedback? Did it help you see patterns in your reasoning?</li>
            	<li><strong>Comparison question:</strong> How did this structured approach differ from Activity 1.1? Which style better suited your learning needs and why? Consider:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The basic approach allows more organic conversation flow</li>
            		<li>The structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage</li>
            		<li>Which pushed you to think harder about your assumptions?</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>Actionable insights:</strong> What specific next steps did the AI suggest, and were they genuinely helpful for advancing your understanding?</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>A structured Socratic approach can ensure no stone is left unturned in examining your thinking. The systematic categories prevent you from avoiding uncomfortable questions and force comprehensive self-examination.</p>

            <h2>2. AI as a Debate &amp; Argumentation Sparring Partner</h2>
            <p>Strong arguments anticipate and address counterpoints. AI can help you prepare for intellectual challenges by taking opposing stances and forcing you to defend your positionâ€”like a practice debate before the real thing.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Present your thesis or argument to AI and ask it to argue against your position. This helps you anticipate objections, identify weaknesses in your reasoning, and build more robust arguments.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Use these prompts to engage AI as your intellectual opponent:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>My thesis is: [your thesis]. Please act as a devil&#x27;s advocate and 
            present the strongest possible counter-arguments. Focus on:
            - Logical weaknesses in my argument
            - Alternative interpretations of my evidence  
            - Unintended consequences I haven&#x27;t considered</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>I&#x27;m writing a paper arguing that [your position]. Help me strengthen 
            my argument by:
            1. Identifying the 3 strongest objections someone might raise
            2. Explaining why each objection seems compelling
            3. Suggesting what evidence opponents might use</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>Here&#x27;s my main argument: [your argument]. Play devil&#x27;s advocate, 
            but stick to legitimate counter-argumentsâ€”no straw man arguments 
            or logical fallacies. After each counter-argument, ask me how I 
            would respond.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> After AI presents counter-arguments, practice responding: &quot;How would I address this objection in my paper?&quot; This prepares you for real academic discourse.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Argument validity:</strong> Were AI&#x27;s counter-arguments logically sound, or did they contain fallacies?</li>
            	<li><strong>Strength assessment:</strong> Did AI identify genuine weaknesses in your position, or just superficial issues?</li>
            	<li><strong>Fallacy detection:</strong> Watch for common logical fallacies AI might use:</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
            <p><i></i> <strong>Example of AI using a fallacy:</strong><br>
            Your argument: &quot;Universities should increase funding for mental health services.&quot;<br>
            AI&#x27;s flawed counter: &quot;But if we fund mental health services, soon we&#x27;ll have to fund everything students want, and the university will go bankrupt.&quot; (Slippery slope fallacy)<br>
            <br>
            A better counter-argument would address actual trade-offs: &quot;Given limited budgets, how should universities balance mental health funding against other student needs like financial aid or academic support?&quot;</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Learning value:</strong> Did this exercise help you see your argument from new angles? What will you change based on this practice?</li>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>AI can simulate intellectual opposition, helping you build stronger arguments by anticipating challenges. But remember: real human critics may raise concerns AI doesn&#x27;t consider, especially those involving values, context, or lived experience.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            ## 1. Role &amp; Purpose
            You are a **Devil&#x27;s Advocate Thought Partner** whose mission is to stress-test any plan or idea I am considering. You surface hidden assumptions, expose weaknesses, and explore alternate approaches so I can refine or reaffirm my thinking with full confidence.

            ## 2. Opening Move
            Begin every new conversation with:
            &gt; &quot;Hiâ€”what plan or idea would you like us to examine?&quot;
            ## 3. Intake Phase
              _Ask only **one** open question at a time and wait for my reply._
              1. Capture:
                - Project overview
                - Main objectives
                - Specific plan or idea under review
              2. Confirm understanding:
                &gt; &quot;Got it. Let&#x27;s stress-test this plan to avoid the consensus trap.&quot;  
                &gt; _Wait for acknowledgment before advancing._

            | **E. Reflect &amp; Refine**     | In â‰¤ 25 words, spotlight logical gaps or overlooked issues and offer one concise suggestion to strengthen the analysis. |

            _Cycle rules: one question per turn; always await my response; if I stall, offer a concrete example to prompt discussion._

            1. Readiness check:
              &gt; &quot;Have we examined every significant risk or alternative you wanted to cover?&quot;
            2. After confirmation, present a bold markdown table:

            | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
            | _(concise description)_ | _(bullet list)_        | _(bullet list)_            |

            3. Close with:
             &gt; &quot;If new questions arise, I&#x27;m here to help examine them.&quot;

            ## 6. Tone &amp; Interaction Rules
                - Warm, respectful, strategicâ€”challenge ideas, not people.
                - Plain language; no fluff.
                - One question per response.
                - Do not create the final table until every question you asked has been answered.

            ## 7. Example Turn
            **User:** &quot;I plan to launch the app in eight weeks.&quot;  
            **AI:**
            1. _Probe Assumptions_ â€“ &quot;What makes eight weeks preferable to twelve?&quot;
            2. _Reflect &amp; Refine_ â€“ &quot;Timeline appears fixed without evidence; reviewing historical dev-cycle data could validate feasibility.

            <p><strong>Strategic tip:</strong> This structured approach prevents the AI from jumping randomly between critiques. The systematic cycle ensures you examine assumptions, alternatives, evidence, and consequences in a logical progression.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Systematic coverage:</strong> Did the structured cycle help uncover issues you wouldn&#x27;t have considered with a basic devil&#x27;s advocate approach?</li>
            	<li><strong>Quality of challenges:</strong> Were the AI&#x27;s questions genuinely challenging your thinking, or were they predictable? The best devil&#x27;s advocacy makes you uncomfortable because it hits real vulnerabilities.</li>
            	<li><strong>Comparison with Activity 2.1:</strong> How did this structured approach differ from the basic devil&#x27;s advocate? Consider:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The basic approach allows more organic opposition</li>
            		<li>The structured approach ensures systematic coverage</li>
            		<li>Which helped you identify more significant weaknesses?</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>The synthesis table:</strong> Was the final summary table helpful in capturing what you learned? Did it reveal patterns in your assumptions?</li>
            	<li><strong>Real-world application:</strong> Think of a project or decision you&#x27;re facing. Would this systematic stress-testing help you prepare better?</li>
            </ul>

            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>Structured devil&#x27;s advocacy ensures you don&#x27;t skip uncomfortable questions. The systematic approach forces examination of assumptions, alternatives, evidence, and consequencesâ€”creating a more robust final plan or argument.</p>

            <p><strong>What you&#x27;ve learned:</strong> You&#x27;ve practiced using AI as a tool for sharpening critical thinking through Socratic questioning and devil&#x27;s advocacy. These techniques help you examine assumptions, anticipate objections, and build more thoughtful arguments.</p>

            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> AI serves best as a thinking catalyst, not a thinking replacement. It can prompt you to question more deeply and argue more carefully, but the critical analysis must come from you.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection questions:</strong></p>

            <ul>
            	<li>How can you use Socratic questioning to improve your understanding in other courses?</li>
            	<li>Think of a paper you&#x27;re writing or a position you hold strongly. What assumptions haven&#x27;t you examined yet?</li>
            	<li>How might these techniques help you in class discussions or study groups?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Moving forward:</strong> Critical thinking is a skill that improves with practice. Use these AI techniques regularly, but also seek out human discussion partners who can challenge you in ways AI cannotâ€”through personal experience, emotional intelligence, and contextual understanding.</p>
