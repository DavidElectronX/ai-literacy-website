                When you use a Generative AI tool, you are using a tool that has been created by a complex and expensive process. To help you develop an understanding of this process, I’m going to rely a bit on an analogy that isn’t perfect but will help with your understanding, at least at a high level.

                Think about how a child learns language – through exposure to countless conversations, books, and interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) learn in a similar way, but instead of years of real-world experience, they learn from vast amounts of text from the internet, books, and other sources. Here’s a basic overview of how these AI models are trained:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Gathering and Preparing the Data:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      Companies collect enormous amounts of data from sources like books, websites, and articles. This data needs to be carefully cleaned and filtered – removing inappropriate content, errors, and low-quality information. Just like you wouldn’t want a child learning from incorrect or harmful material, the AI needs good quality data to learn from.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Basic Training:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The AI begins recognizing patterns in all this text – not just learning words, but understanding how they typically appear together and relate to each other. Unlike a child who learns strict grammar rules, the AI learns by spotting patterns in millions (or even billions) of examples. It starts recognizing which words often appear together, what typically follows certain phrases, and how ideas are usually expressed.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Alignment:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The model is then trained to be helpful and safe – like teaching good manners and proper behavior. The training involves guiding the AI towards providing useful, appropriate responses while limiting harmful or biased content. This process is called
                      <em>
                        alignment
                      </em>
                      .
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Testing and Release:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The AI is thoroughly tested to make sure it works well and safely. Once ready, it’s made available for people to use, but continues to be monitored and improved over time.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                These AI models are continuously being improved and refined. However, it’s important to remember that despite this sophisticated training process, these models are still pattern-matching tools – they don’t truly understand or think like humans do. They’re incredibly powerful assistants, but they need human guidance and oversight to be used effectively.

                Inference – Using a GenAI Model
              </h3>
              <p>
                When you use a GenAI chatbot, you are interacting with a user interface but behind the scenes is a GenAI model working hard to calculate a response to your prompts. This calculation process is called inference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is what happens during inference:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Processing Your Input:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The model splits your text into small chunks called tokens (imagine splitting a sentence into individual words and parts of words – like breaking “playing” into “play” and “ing”). This helps the model understand your input piece by piece.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Using Its “Knowledge”:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The model then uses all the patterns it learned during its training – kind of like how you use everything you’ve learned in school to answer a question. But instead of actively searching through books, the model uses its “memory” (the patterns stored in its system) to figure out what might come next.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Making Smart Predictions:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The model looks at your input and what it has started writing, considering everything together (like how you consider the whole question before answering). It then figures out what would make the most sense to say next, one small piece at a time.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Adding Some Variety:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      The model has special settings (like a creativity dial) that control how creative or focused its response should be. A higher setting means more creative and varied responses, while a lower setting means more focused and predictable ones.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>
                      Building the Response:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                      Finally, the model builds its response one small piece at a time. Each new piece it adds is influenced by everything that came before it – both in your prompt and in the response it’s creating. It’s like building with blocks, where each new block needs to fit with all the others.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Remember:
                </strong>
                The model isn’t thinking or understanding like a human does. It’s following patterns it learned during training to create responses that make sense based on your input. It’s more like a very sophisticated pattern-matching tool than a thinking brain.

            A machine learning model that's pre-trained to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. This is the GPT part of ChatGPT. They're designed to understand and generate human-like text. Here's a simplified breakdown of its name and function:
            <br>
            <strong>
              Generative
            </strong>
            : This refers to the model's ability to create or generate new content. In the case of GPT, it can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. For instance, it can help in writing essays, answering questions, or even creating poetry.
            <br>
            <strong>
              Pre-trained
            </strong>
            : Before a model like GPT can be used, it needs to be trained on a large dataset of text. "Pre-trained" refers to the fact that this training occurs before the model is fine-tuned for specific tasks. The pre-training helps the model learn about grammar, facts about the world, reasoning abilities, and also some common sense.
            <br>
            <strong>
              Transformers
            </strong>
            : Transformer is the type of neural network architecture that GPT is based on. It's particularly effective for handling sequential data like text or time series data. The Transformer architecture allows GPT to pay selective attention to different parts of the input text, which helps in understanding the context and generating coherent responses.

            Inference
          </h3>
          <p>
            Inference is the process where a trained AI model uses its learned knowledge to make predictions or generate outputs based on new input data. In the context of an LLM (Large Language Model), inference happens when the model takes a user’s input (prompt) and processes it to produce a meaningful response.
          </p>
          <p>
            During inference, the model applies the parameters (like weights and biases) it learned during training to evaluate the input, recognize patterns, and generate an appropriate output. This process is what allows the model to "understand" and respond to prompts, answer questions, or generate creative content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inference is essentially the application phase of an AI model, turning training into practical use. It’s how the model uses what it has learned to interact with the world

            Interpretability
          </h3>
          <p>
            The degree to which the outputs and operations of a machine learning model can be understood by humans.

            Machine Learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

            Natural Language Processing (NLP)
          </h3>
          <p>
            A domain of AI enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

          <h3>
            Parameters
          </h3>
          <p>
            The rules or settings that an LLM uses to "understand" and generate language. There are two main types of parameters in an LLM: weights and biases. Weights are numbers that show how strong the connections are between different parts of the LLM. Biases are numbers that help adjust the output of the LLM. Together, weights and biases control how the LLM processes and produces language. Generally, the more parameters an LLM has, the more powerful it becomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parameters are the internal variables that the model learns through training. They help the model make predictions or decisions based on input data.
