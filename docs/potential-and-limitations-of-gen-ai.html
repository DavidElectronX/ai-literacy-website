                    is available, easy to access, easy to use, and a powerful tool when used correctly. Students and educators alike are already using it and making an impact on their learning and teaching. It promises benefits like enhanced personalized learning, accelerated curriculum development, and real-time feedback; but it can also support drawbacks like cheating, plagiarism, and serving as a crutch to bypass critical thinking. The task to ensure we maximize its potential to elevate learning and minimize the potential to undermine it is one of the key challenges we face as educators.

                      </strong>
                      On the previous page, data privacy came up as an issue over and over again. Anytime that you enter something into a chatbot, you are "feeding the beast", i.e., giving the AI company even more data. Different AI companies will have different privacy policies, but the reality is you are sending them your (or your students') information and despite the policies, they have your data. AI companies are aware of these issues and are working on ways to support privacy-sensitive applications. One potential way to support privacy is to provide a private server for institutes. These are in the works, but currently require a large investment and/or a lot of specialized expertise.

                        Equity and Access Issues:
                      </strong>
                      AI can seem magical and spellbinding but it is not universally accessible. Not only are some LLMs geographically locked down, but the best tools cost money. The digital divide is real, and the question lingers - how do we ensure that every learner, irrespective of their socio-economic status has equal access.

                        Everything it Outputs is Made Up:
                      </strong>
                      This is a crucial point that's often overlooked - LLMs don't actually "know" anything in the way humans do. They create their responses by predicting what words should come next based on patterns in their training data. While these predictions can be remarkably accurate and useful, they're still essentially sophisticated guesses. This means that even when an AI sounds completely confident, it might be completely wrong, or worse, it might blend truth and fiction in ways that are hard to detect. This is particularly problematic in education where accuracy and reliability are paramount.

                        Output May Not Be Reliable or Consistent:
                      </strong>
                      Ask an LLM the same question twice, and you'll likely get two different answers. While these answers might convey similar information, they can vary significantly in their details, depth, and sometimes even accuracy. This inconsistency can be particularly challenging in educational settings where we need dependable, standardized information. Bottom line: Every AI output needs human verification, and using this critical verification skill is essential.

                        Overuse and Overreliance
                      </strong>
                      : When individuals depend too heavily on AI for tasks like writing, problem-solving, or creative ideation, there's a risk of diminishing their own critical thinking, analytical skills, and domain-specific expertise. Instead of developing a deep understanding or honing their abilities through practice, users might simply accept AI-generated outputs without sufficient scrutiny or personal engagement. This can lead to a passive learning approach, hinder the development of essential cognitive skills, and ultimately make individuals less capable when faced with novel situations or tasks where AI assistance is unavailable or inappropriate. Fostering a balance where AI serves as an assistant rather than a replacement is crucial to ensure that human intellect and creativity continue to flourish.

                      The integration of AI into educational settings will require many teachers to re-examine their style and their approach to education.

                      The rise of generative AI gives rise to a number of other ethical considerations, many of which we should consider as we integrate generative AI into our teaching and learning practices.

                          LLMs can perpetuate and amplify existing biases because of the data they were trained on.

                          The data used for training may have come from sources the LLMs didn't have explicit rights to use. Should we consider not using an LLM because it may have violated intellectual property rights?

It's not quite there yet, but if the pace of AI development over the last year or so is any indication, we are not far off. As a counter to this pro, we, as educators, really have to think deeply about what our role will be.

                      Are generative AI tools actually creative? I don't know the answer to that, I do know that if you ask a chatbot for 50 unique ideas for a business related to shoe repair, it will give you 50 (or about 50, it's not always great at counting) ideas in less than 30 seconds. Now, most of those ideas will be not so great, but I'm sure a few will be worthy of some thought and there may be a diamond. Even if you don't use any of the ideas, you will probably be inspired for a new idea based on the ones the AI gives you. The best haiku I've ever written was 75% written by me, but 25% inspired by an idea that ChatGPT gave me.

                      I recently took a course on course design supported by AI. The course facilitator had created a number of comprehensive prompts that helped us create a learner profile, generate knowledge maps and learning outcomes, and then a storyboard for a course. One thing that we (all the students) remarked on was that, while the AI did not actually save us much time, the quality of work that we produced was much better than if we did it without the AI. Having the AI as an idea generator and then sounding board to bounce other ideas off of significantly improved our work.

                        AI is Good at Giving Data-Driven Insights:
                      </strong>
                      Really, this is all AI does. It makes connections between the data that you train it with and then uses those connections to provide "insight" into any new data that you feed it. Image generators do this with pixels and LLMs do this with words. LLMs also do this with numbers and since data is really nothing more than a bunch of organized words and numbers LLMs are surprisingly good at analyzing spreadsheets, creating spreadsheets from raw data, and even highlighting links in data that you may have missed. ChatGPT Plus in Advanced Data Analysis mode is the best gen AI tool for doing this kind of thing.

                    about using generative AI like ChatGPT in education. This student was very motivated to learn but found some courses irrelevant. Due to a heavy course load, they focused on the courses they felt most relevant and used ChatGPT for the rest. Many students feel the same, especially when overwhelmed with work, and turn to ChatGPT for help. Cases like this show the willingness of students to use generative AI to cheat, but students also seem to understand the risks of doing so which they identified as not just academic penalties but also the learning they miss out on.

                      When ChatGPT was first released in November 2022, many teachers had a moment of panic and thought that either "this is the end of education as we know it
                      " or "this is the end of education as we know it
                      ". Proponents like Ethan Mollick fully embraced ChatGPT and sought the best ways to use it in his classes. At the same time, school districts like the one in New York City banned ChatGPT outright because they didn't know how to deal with it at the time. Ethan Mollick's level of adoption is beyond what most of us know how to do and NYC school's reaction was an excessive knee-jerk reaction to the new technology that has since been reversed. Now that the initial reactions are behind us, many educators have put a lot of thought into how to best make use of LLMs like ChatGPT to support the education of our students. Institutes have added AI to their academic policies and most of these that I have read are permissive and generally put the choice of if and how to allow its use in the hands of the teachers and professors. Institutes have also released guidelines on how educators might use AI in their classes along with suggestions on how to adapt assignments to support its use.

                  <p>
                    It's clear that most teachers are going to need to change their practices somewhat, but the amount of change will vary from level to level and from topic to topic. Primary school teachers have likely changed their approach very little and instructors teaching exclusively hands-on topics probably haven't changed much either. On the other hand first year English and computer science professors have likely had to change their approach a lot - these are courses for which ChatGPT can probably help the most (write an essay, write some simple code), and first year courses (especially ones that students only take because they have to) are the courses in which students are most likely to look for outside "help". The value of the AI output for courses like this is high and so is the incentive.

                  <p>
                    Most educators are finding a middle ground between full adoption and complete rejection, adapting their teaching methods thoughtfully rather than radically. The key is to focus on what matters most: developing students' critical thinking, creativity, and ability to evaluate information. In many ways, AI is pushing us to do what good teachers have always done - move beyond rote learning to deeper understanding. The challenge now isn't just teaching subject matter, but teaching students how to learn and think in a world where AI is a constant companion.
