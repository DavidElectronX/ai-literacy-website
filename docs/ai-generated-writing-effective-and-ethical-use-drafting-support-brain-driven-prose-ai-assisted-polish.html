            <h1><i></i>Drafting Support: Brain-Driven Prose, AI-Assisted Polish</h1>

            <div>
            <div>
            <p>When pre-writing, you drew the blueprint by crafting a thesis, outline, and audience profile. Now you&#x27;ll build the prose, leaning on GenAI as a writing coach but not as your ghost-writer.</p>

            <p>Drafting is where the temptation to outsource your thinking is the strongest. The activities here are designed to help you resist that temptation, keeping you in creative and critical control. You will use AI <em>only</em> for targeted feedback, option-generation, and diagnostic checks on text <em>you have already written</em>. Exercise your brain; build those neural paths so that critical thinking becomes easier and more natural. Then get AI feedback to reveal blind spots and help you polish your prose.</p>

            <p>Every activity in this section is built on a three-step workflow. This process ensures you are always doing the heavy intellectual lifting.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>The Core Workflow: Your Three-Step Process</h5>

            <p><strong>1. Brain First ➜</strong> You create the raw material. This means writing the initial clunky sentence, the underdeveloped paragraph, or the full first draft. The thinking and the words originate with you.</p>

            <p><strong>2. AI for Options ➜</strong> You take your self-generated text to the AI. You prompt it to act as a coach, an editor, or a strategist—requesting <em>feedback</em>, <em>analysis</em>, or <em>alternative options</em> (phrasing, structure, examples), never the final answer.</p>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Never paste copyrighted or private data into public models.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>3. Use Your Judgement ➜</strong> You critically evaluate the AI&#x27;s output. You are the final authority. You accept, reject, or modify the suggestions based on your own judgment, voice, and argumentative goals.</p>

            <div>
            <p>New MIT research shows that when students use LLMs for writing, they experience reduced brain connectivity, lower satisfaction, and impaired ownership of their ideas. The convenience of using an LLM comes with genuine cognitive costs. We&#x27;re not saying avoid AI; we are saying that if you do the intellectual heavy lifting first, then use AI strategically for feedback and refinement, you&#x27;ll build your brain AND be more proud of the end result.</p>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To write a fully developed and substantiated paragraph starting with a single topic sentence from your outline.</p>

            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Write out a complete paragraph that provides evidence, analysis, and significance for your main point. Then, use targeted AI feedback to identify and strengthen the paragraph&#x27;s weakest link.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

            <p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong> This is where you do the real work of drafting. Your goal is to build a complete paragraph from a single idea.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Start with your Point:</strong> Write down one topic sentence from your outline.</li>
            	<li><strong>Add your Evidence:</strong> Write a sentence that introduces a piece of evidence (a fact, quote, or data point) to support that point.</li>
            	<li><strong>Provide your Analysis:</strong> Write 2+ sentences explaining what the evidence <em>means</em> and how it proves your point.</li>
            	<li><strong>State the Significance:</strong> Write a final sentence that connects the entire paragraph back to your paper&#x27;s main thesis. Why does this point matter?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You have now drafted a complete paragraph entirely on your own.</p>

            <p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Now, use the AI as a quality auditor. The prompt below asks the AI to diagnose potential weaknesses and asks you a question about it. It is not intended to rewrite anything for you.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a writing coach. I have drafted a paragraph using the Point -&gt; Evidence -&gt; Analysis -&gt; Significance structure.

            My paragraph:
            &quot;[Paste your full, self-written paragraph here]&quot;

            Your task is to:
            1. Identify the weakest part of my paragraph (Is the analysis too shallow? Is the evidence not clearly connected to the point? Is the significance unclear?).
            2. Ask me specific, probing questions that will force me to think more deeply about how to strengthen that single part. Do not rewrite any part of my paragraph.</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ol>
            	<li>Do you agree with the AI&#x27;s diagnosis? Why do you think it identified <em>that specific part</em> of your paragraph as the weakest?</li>
            	<li>Take a moment to answer the AI&#x27;s question in your own words. How did answering it help you see a gap in your original draft?</li>
            	<li>Based on your answer, revise your original paragraph. What specific changes did you make to the evidence, analysis, or significance to make the paragraph stronger?</li>

            <p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Model the Process:</strong> Before students try this, model it live. Start with a topic sentence and &quot;think aloud&quot; as you write the evidence, analysis, and significant sentences.</li>
            	<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Coaching:</strong> For an AI-free version, have students swap paragraphs and perform the AI&#x27;s role: identify the weakest part and ask one probing question.</li>
            	<li><strong>Focus on the &quot;Why&quot;:</strong> The most valuable part of this exercise is the student&#x27;s answer to the AI&#x27;s question. Assess their ability to reflect on and deepen their own analysis.</li>
            	<li><strong>Connect to Outlining:</strong> Reinforce that a clear, focused topic sentence (from their outline) makes the entire accordion expansion process dramatically easier and more effective.</li>
            </ul>

            2. In the second column, alongside the suggestion, add a brief justification that explains *why* the new word is a better fit for the persona (e.g., &quot;replaces a casual idiom with a more formal term,&quot; &quot;uses a verb with a more analytical connotation&quot;).</code></pre>

            <p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Audience Guessing Game:</strong> Have students review a partner&#x27;s &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; paragraphs and try to guess the intended audience persona. A misidentification is a great learning moment about tone.</li>
            	<li><strong>Focus on Rejection:</strong> Ask students to share one AI suggestion they <em>rejected</em> and their reason why. This highlights their critical judgment and authorial control.</li>
            	<li><strong>Build a &quot;Tone Lexicon&quot;:</strong> Create a class document where students add effective word swaps they discovered for different tones (e.g., Formal, Persuasive, Skeptical).</li>
            	<li><strong>Connect to Pre-writing:</strong> This activity directly demonstrates the practical value of the &quot;Audience-Persona Mirror&quot; activity, showing students how planning pays off in revision.</li>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To craft clear and logical transitions that guide your reader smoothly from one idea to the next, reinforcing the overall coherence of your argument.</p>

            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Analyze the logical link between two paragraphs, use an AI to generate options for executing that link, and select or craft a transition that best serves your argument.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

            <p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

            <ol>
            	<li>Select two adjacent paragraphs from your draft.</li>
            	<li>For each paragraph, write a single sentence that states its main point or claim.</li>
            	<li>Now, write one sentence that describes the <strong>logical relationship</strong> between those two points. (e.g., &quot;Paragraph 2 provides a specific example of the general claim in Paragraph 1,&quot; or &quot;Paragraph 2 presents a counterargument to the idea in Paragraph 1.&quot;)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Use the prompt below. Providing your analysis of the relationship is the key to getting high-quality, relevant suggestions from your AI coach.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a writing coach specializing in argument structure. My goal is to create a strong transition between two paragraphs.

            Main Point of Paragraph 1:
            &quot;[Paste the main point of your first paragraph]&quot;

            Main Point of Paragraph 2:
            &quot;[Paste the main point of your second paragraph]&quot;

            My analysis of the logical relationship:
            &quot;[Paste your sentence describing the relationship]&quot;

            Based on my analysis, provide:
            1. Several distinct transition sentences or phrases that effectively signal this logical relationship to the reader.
            2. For each option, label the primary rhetorical move it uses (e.g., Cause &amp; Effect, Elaboration, Concession, Comparison).</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ol>
            	<li>Compare the rhetorical moves suggested by the AI to your own initial analysis. Did the AI offer a more precise or effective way to frame the relationship you identified?</li>
            	<li>Why is the transition you ultimately chose the most effective for guiding your reader? What specific signal does it send them about the information that is about to come?</li>
            	<li>Read the two paragraphs with your new transition aloud. How does it improve the overall flow and logic of your argument?</li>

            <p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Rhetorical Move Sort:</strong> Before the activity, give students a list of common transition words (&quot;Therefore,&quot; &quot;However,&quot; &quot;In addition,&quot; &quot;Similarly&quot;) and have them sort them into categories by function.</li>
            	<li><strong>Focus on the &quot;Relationship Sentence&quot;:</strong> The sentence students write in the &quot;Brain First&quot; step is the most important part of the exercise. Use it as a diagnostic tool to see if they understand their own argument&#x27;s structure.</li>
            	<li><strong>Make Thinking Visible:</strong> Have students highlight their final transition sentence in their draft and add a comment explaining the rhetorical move they chose and why.</li>
            	<li><strong>Peer Review the Flow:</strong> In pairs, have students read each other&#x27;s two paragraphs (with the new transition) and describe the logical journey the writer took them on.</li>
            </ul>

            <code>Act as a writing instructor evaluating the introduction of a paper.

            My draft introduction:
            &quot;[Paste your full introduction paragraph here]&quot;

            Your task is to analyze my draft based on the three core jobs of an introduction:
            1.  **The Hook:** Quote the sentence(s) you believe act as the hook. Is it effective at grabbing the reader&#x27;s attention?
            2.  **The Context:** Briefly describe the context my introduction provides. Is it sufficient for a reader to understand the topic?
            3.  **The Thesis:** Quote the sentence you believe is my thesis statement. Is it clear, specific, and arguable?</code></pre>

            Your task is to analyze my draft based on the three core jobs of a conclusion:
            1.  **The Synthesis:** Does the paragraph briefly synthesize the paper&#x27;s main points (without just listing them)?
            2.  **The &quot;So What?&quot;:** Identify the sentence(s) that explain the broader significance, implications, or importance of my argument.
            3.  **The Final Thought:** Does the paragraph offer a memorable final thought that leaves a lasting impression?</code></pre>
