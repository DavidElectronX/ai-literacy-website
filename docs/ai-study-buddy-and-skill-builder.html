              Moving Beyond Information Retrieval
            </h2>
            <p>
              This is a shifting from asking AI for facts to engaging it in a dialogue. We're not just typing "What is photosynthesis?" anymore. Instead, we're exploring how AI can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Explain complex concepts in multiple ways until they click
              </li>
              <li>
                Generate study material tailored to your specific needs
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide feedback on your work (with appropriate caveats)
              </li>
              <li>
                Help organize your study plans
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can use AI to
              <em>
                actively engage
              </em>
              with your learning material and skill development, not just passively give you information.
            </p>

              Remember our "Weightlifting vs. Forklifting" analogy? This section is firmly in the

                weightlifting camp
              </strong>
              . The AI tools and techniques we'll explore are designed to help
              <em>
                you
              </em>
              do the intellectual heavy lifting.

            <div>
              <h3>
                Think of it this way:
              </h3>
              <p>
                AI provides the resistance, the feedback, and the support that helps you build your mental muscles—your understanding, your critical thinking, and your skills. AI isn't here to do the work
                <em>
                  for
                </em>
                you, but to help you do your work
                <em>
                  better
                </em>
                and learn more deeply in the process.

            The Unwavering Importance of Your Critical Thinking
          </h2>
          <p>
            It might seem like we are
            <strong>
              on repeat
            </strong>
            with this critical thinking stuff but it truly bears repeating and repeating and repeating. Generative AI is powerful but not infallible and your brain is the only protection against its weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make mistakes (aka "hallucinations" - I prefer "
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5127162" target="_blank">
                mirage

              ")
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Therefore, anything an AI generates must be treated as a draft, a suggestion, or a piece of raw material that
            <em>
              you
            </em>
            need to process.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              Module 2: AI as Your Critical Thinking Partner
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learn to use AI to challenge your assumptions, refine your arguments, and see issues from multiple perspectives.
            </p>
          </div>

              Module 3: AI for Honing Communication Skills (Beyond Writing)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Discover how AI can support you in developing your presentation skills and even assist in language learning.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              Module 4: AI for Personalized Study Management & Information Organization
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learn how AI can help you tailor your study plans and manage your academic information more effectively.
            </p>
