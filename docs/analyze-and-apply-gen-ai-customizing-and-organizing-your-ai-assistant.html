                AI assistants have evolved beyond simple chat interfaces and now offer sophisticated organization and customization capabilities. The following outlines these various capabilities which allow for management of chats, files and workflows, supported by customized instructions for user defined purposes.

                    During your chats, Chatbots will sometimes identify a statement as important and save it to memory. These memories are referenced during every chat and the information is used if the chatbot thinks it's appropriate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if you mention that you like hiking, it will probably save that to memory. Then in a later chat if you are talking about visiting Vancouver, it may bring up the fact that there is lots of good hiking around Vancouver.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Memory can be purposely added to. In the chat if you say something like "Remember that chocolate ice cream is my favourite", it will add that to the memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Memory can deleted. For example, my ChatGPT memory has a statement "Mentioned that their winter tires have 6/32 inch of tread left". This is irrelevant for any future chats, so I should probably delete it.

                    A Custom Assistant is a personalized version of a standard AI chatbot that you can create without needing to code. By providing specific instructions, and often uploading files for extra knowledge, you can tailor the AI to consistently handle particular tasks, adopt specific roles (like a writing editor or coding partner), or act as an expert in a certain area, saving you time and effort on recurring activities.

                    An AI "Project" serves as a dedicated digital workspace to organize everything related to a specific task or goal. Think of it as a focused folder where you can keep relevant chats, documents, and specific instructions for the AI assistant, ensuring it stays on track and understands the context of your work without needing constant reminders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ChatGPT and Claude both offer a Projects feature (paid version only)
