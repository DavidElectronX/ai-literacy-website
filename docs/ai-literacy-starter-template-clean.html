              <li>

              1. Prompting Examples: Basic vs. Detailed
            </h2>
            <p>
              Imagine you are in an environmental science class and have discovered a recent, lengthy report online about a new study on glacier melt. You want a quick summary to understand the key findings to see if it's relebvant to your current topic on climate change impacts before investing time.

              <strong>
                Basic Prompt:

            <pre>              <code>Summarize this article.</code></pre>

              You might get a general summary, but its length, focus, and tone could vary widely. It might be too long, too technical, or miss the points most relevant to educators.
            </p>
            <p>

              <li>
                <strong>
                  Audience:
                </strong>
                "environmental science student" informs the AI about the user's background knowledge and the appropriate level of technical detail.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Goal
                </strong>
                : Stating the goal ("quickly understand if the report is relevant...") helps the AI prioritize information pertinent to making that judgment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Task Focus:
                </strong>
                Specifying "main data presented" and "predicted future impacts" directs the AI to extract the most crucial information for the student's purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Format:
                </strong>
                "Provide a two sentence summary..." ensures the summary is brief and easy to scan for relevance.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The result is likely to be far more targeted, relevant, and immediately useful for your specific need.

                  Specificity Matters:
                </strong>
                Vague prompts lead to vague or unpredictable results. Clearly define what you want.

                  Context is Crucial:

                Tell the AI about the audience, the purpose, or the background information it needs to generate a relevant response.

              <li>
                <strong>

                <strong>
                  Assign a Role (Optional but Powerful):

                Asking the AI to "Act as..." can significantly shape the tone, style, and expertise level of the response.

                  Iteration is Key:
                </strong>
                Don't expect the perfect response on the first try. Analyze the output and refine your prompt based on what you see. This aligns with the iterative learning approach we've discussed.

                </strong>
                Pick something relevant to your studies where an AI could assist (e.g., explaining a difficult concept from class, brainstorming arguments for a debate topic, drafting an email to a professor, summarizing a complex reading
                <em>
                  for a specific purpose

                Write your initial prompt in one of the AI tools linked below.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Analyze the Response:
                </strong>
                Read the AI's first output. Is it exactly what you wanted? Probably not! Where does it fall short? (Too vague? Wrong tone? Missing key info? Wrong format?)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Choose Your Next Move:
                </strong>
                Select 1-2 refinement strategies from the Framework list above. How can you clarify or redirect the AI? Consider getting it to ask you clarifying questions!

                  Continue the Conversation:

                Write and submit your refined prompt based on the strategy you chose.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Compare Outputs:
                </strong>
                Look at the first and second responses side-by-side. Did the conversation move in the right direction? How did your refinement change the outcome?
              </li>

                <strong>
                  Keep Chatting (Optional):
                </strong>
                If it's still not quite right, repeat steps 4-6. Sometimes it takes a few exchanges to get the AI aligned with your goal.
