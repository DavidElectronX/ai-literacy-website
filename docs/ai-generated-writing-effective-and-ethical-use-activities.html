If you cannot get peer feedback, then you do the revising and editing activities yourself and compare to what the AI gives you.

                                  <code>You are an _academic writing coach_ with experience teaching university writing courses. Please review my full draft (pasted below) and build a **reverse outline**.

            The purpose of a reverse outline is to help determine if the paper meets its goals, discover places where you might need to expand evidence or analysis, and identify where readers might struggle with your organization or structure.

            A reverse outline extracts the main claim of each paragraph so the writer can inspect logic, structure, and flow **after** drafting.

            Here are the steps for creating a reverse outline:
            1. Read through the entire draft to understand the thesis and overall arc
            2. For each body paragraph: identify its core idea -> this is sentence 'a'; and identify its rhetorical job -> this is sentence 'b'
            3. Number the sentences 1a, 1b, 2a etc. 
            4. Review the numbered list to analyze the paper's logical flow and structure and create a Structural Observations commentary where you note the strengthes, flag gaps or redundancies and suggest fixes.

            Formatting:
            - Keep each (a)/(b) sentence ≤ 30 words.
            - Keep the **Structural Observations** section ≤ 200 words.

                        Let students exchange their first-draft prompts and “debug” each other’s wording for clarity, specificity, and ethical boundaries before ever consulting the AI.

              With a solid structure confirmed, editing is your chance to zoom in on the craft of writing. In this stage you will improve the clarity, impact, and style of your prose. You'll use AI as a

              </strong>
              , to provide feedback on sentence construction, word choice, and paragraph coherence.

              Proofreading

            <p>
              If we stick with our initial definition of proofreading (Grammar & Punctuation Errors, Spelling Mistakes, Formatting Issues, Typos), it's clear that proofreading is mostly a mechanical, rules-based activity. In most cases, using an AI tool to do these checks is acceptable, even in classes where using AI is strictly prohibited. In fact, it is difficult to
              <em>
                avoid
              </em>
              using an AI tool to do these checks. If you are working in MS Word, you are going to get grammar and spelling suggestions automatically and these are driven by AI. That being said, a final proofread by a human is always necessary to catch those things that AI still misses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Word processors like Word and Google Docs have built-in proofreading but there are many other AI tools that are designed for proofreading (and editing). Two of the most popular are Grammarly and Quillbot, but there are many others. The other tool worth mentioning is

            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, for proofreading, I prefer to rely on the built-in tools in Microsoft for the basic stuff, chatbots with targeted prompts for a more detailed check, and then doing a final check with my own eyes. It makes the process intentional and I can prompt for specific things with each (grammar, vocabulary enrichment, verb tense consistency, passive vs. active voice). The main downside is that this an extra step that requires cutting and pasting whereas tools like Grammarly are built right into the text editor.

                Your proofreading process is up to you, but remember that for every new tool that you use, you are sharing your personal information and your work with another company. I know that people rarely do this, but read the privacy policy and data agreement to understand what the company is going to do with your data and work.

Walking through the half-finished frame, the LED grow lights looked far too bright for seedlings. The project charter promises to reduce waste, improving neighborhood engagement, and to create seasonal teaching modules for local schools.

            None of the preliminary safety tests was conclusive, but the team declares that the system “operates flawlessly” in internal memos. Volunteers assembled the seed racks before dawn the installation crew, however, arrived after lunch and had to reposition every tray. During a radio interview, the project lead explained that the guiding slogan is “grow local, learn global, and share endlessly. To hyper-optimize our community-facing deliverables, we must granularly gamify the outreach funnels so the stakeholders feel maximum uplift vibes.</code></pre>
