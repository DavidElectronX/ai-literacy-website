            <p>Pre-writing (e.g., brainstorming, free-writing, clustering, and outlining) transforms a vague topic into a workable blueprint. Done well, it identifies hidden angles and ideas, spots weak links early, and saves drafting time later. AI can act as an always-on collaborator, offering fresh perspectives and fast categorization without stealing your voice. The activities that follow combine hands-on exercises with targeted prompts so you stay in control while the machine handles the heavy lifting.</p>

            	<li><strong>Breadth vs. Depth</strong>: Do the starred angles cover multiple dimensions (history, sociology, personal narrative)? If all sit in one lane, revisit Phase 3 and request angles for missing dimensions.</li>
            	<li><strong>Feasibility scan</strong>: Pick two starred angles and spend 5 minutes searching your library database: can you locate at least one quality source for each? If not, swap them out.</li>

            <p><i></i><strong>Verify Every Factual Claim</strong></p>

            <p>An AI might suggest a compelling statistic, case study, or quote. However, it can also invent these details (&quot;hallucination&quot;). These fabrications often sound plausible but are not real. Treat every factual claim from an AI as a lead, not a fact. Your next step is to go to your library&#x27;s databases to find the <em>actual</em> study, report, or quote. Never cite a source provided by an AI without first locating and reading it yourself.</p>
