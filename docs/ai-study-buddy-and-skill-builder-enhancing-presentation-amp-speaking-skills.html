            <h2><i></i>Enhancing Presentation &amp; Speaking Skills</h2>
            <p>Successful presentations have strong narratives and are able to connect with an audience. In this section, you&#x27;ll learn to use AI as a structural strategist to organize your ideas and as a private coach to refine your delivery. This section provides a three-part process for using AI as a presentation partner:</p>

            <ol>
            	<li>A toolkit to help you efficiently draft your content and the presentation<br>
            	 </li>
            	<li>A stress-test activity to refine the presentation<br>
            	 </li>
            	<li>A feedback activity to get AI to provide tips on improving your presentation (it&#x27;s better to get human input for this, but the advantage of AI is that it&#x27;s always there to help out when a human isn&#x27;t)<br>
            	 </li>
            </ol>

            <div>
            <details><summary> <i></i> <span>Presentation Activity 1: Create a Presentation</span> </summary>

            <div>
            <p>Creating a presentation has some similarities to writing a paper in that you want the presentation to represent your thoughts and your views, but you also want to find ways to simplify the process without removing your agency. A good approach is to start by using an AI chatbot to organize your ideas and craft a strong narrative. Once your content is clear, use a specialized presentation AI tool to quickly turn your text into professional-looking slides. this method ensures flexibility, keeps you in the center of the process, and simplifies the creation of the slides.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Purpose</h4>

            <p>Craft a clear, audience-focused presentation by leveraging AI as your behind-the-scenes strategist and your slide generating expert.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Kick things off with your original ideas. Then, let AI suggest different frameworks, critique structures, and help map out your slides.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><i></i>Step 1: Develop the Presentation Content</h3>

            <p>Use one of the prompts below as a starting point or develop your own. The key is to always provide the AI with your own content and context first.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 1: You have a finished paper or report and need to turn it into a presentation.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a communication expert. I&#x27;m adapting a research paper into a 10-minute presentation for an audience of [Describe your audience]. My core message for them is [State your single most important takeaway]. Based on the text I&#x27;ve pasted below, please extract the 3-4 main arguments and structure them into a logical 5-slide outline with headlines and key talking points.</code></pre>

            <h4>Scenario 2: You have raw data (from a survey, experiment, etc.) and need to build a story around it.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a data storyteller. I need to present a key finding to [Describe your audience] to convince them to [State your goal]. My key finding is: &#x27;[State your data&#x27;s headline in one sentence]&#x27;. Please suggest a simple 3-part narrative (hook, data reveal, so what?) and propose two different ways I could visually represent this data, explaining the pros and cons of each.</code></pre>

            <h4>Scenario 3: You are starting from scratch with a broad topic.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a creative strategist. I need to develop a presentation on [Your Topic] for [Your Audience]. Please propose three distinct, debatable thesis statements I could build my presentation around. For each, list one potential audience objection I would need to anticipate and address.</code></pre>

            <h3><i></i>Step 2: Choose an AI Tool for Creating the Actual Presentation</h3>

            <p>After developing your content, pick an AI presentation tool to quickly generate slides. I&#x27;ll leave it to you to pick the tool and figure out how to use it - the two I&#x27;ve recommended below are fairly intuitive to use.</p>

            <h4>Some Options:</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Gamma.app</strong> Gamma turns a short text prompt or document into a scrollable slide deck.

            	<ul>
            		<li>not recommended - no free version, only a free trial</li>
            		<li>free trial limits input features</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Notes for Instructors</h5>

            <p>If you are going to do this activity in your class, here are some suggestions:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>Model the &quot;brain-first outline ➜ AI options ➜ human evaluation&quot; flow for building a presentation</li>
            	<li>Require an <em>AI contribution statement</em> slide and a slide reflecting on the use of AI for the presentation</li>
            	<li>Fact check one data point on each student&#x27;s slide during the presentation</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            </div>
            </details>

            <details><summary> <i></i> <span>Presentation Activity 2: The Presentation Stress-Test (For Feedback)</span> </summary>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Purpose</h4>

            <p>Use AI to evaluate your presentation draft from multiple perspectives, uncovering weaknesses in your argument, clarity, and structure.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>You will take your completed presentation draft (the slide headlines and key talking points) and subject it to a &quot;stress-test&quot; by asking an AI to role-play three different critical personas.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h3>

            <h4>Use your brain first:</h4>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Prepare Your Draft:</strong> Open a document and paste in your presentation outline. This should include the title, and for each slide, the headline and the main bullet points you plan to discuss. This is the artifact the AI will analyze.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>AI Input:</h4>

            <ol start="2">
            	<li>Copy your entire presentation outline and paste it into each of the prompts below to get feedback from multiple perspectives (you can modify the perspectives/personas as you see fit)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Prompt 1:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a bright but curious first-year university student. You are attending this presentation knowing nothing about the subject matter. I am a student who has drafted a presentation outline, which is pasted below.

            Your task is to identify every point of confusion. Pinpoint any jargon or technical terms I failed to explain. Highlight any logical jumps where you felt lost or weren&#x27;t sure how I got from one point to the next. List the specific questions that came to your mind as you were reading.

            Please format your feedback as a simple list of questions and comments. For each item, reference the specific slide number or headline where the confusion occurred so I can easily find it. 

            Your tone should be inquisitive but critique my presentation freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            Here is my outline:
            [Paste your presentation  here]</code></pre>

            <h4>Prompt 2:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a tenured professor and a leading expert in this specific field. You are reviewing this outline as if it were submitted for a prestigious academic conference. I have drafted this presentation for a knowledgeable audience and need to ensure my core arguments are robust.

            Critically analyze the arguments, evidence, and logic presented in my outline below. Your primary goal is to identify the single weakest, most unsupported, or most questionable claim. Then, formulate the single most challenging, insightful question you would ask me during the Q&amp;A session.

            Structure your feedback in two distinct parts:
            1. **Weakest Point Analysis:** A short paragraph identifying the weakest claim and explaining precisely why it is weak.
            2. **The Killer Question:** The single, well-formulated question you would ask.

            Your tone should be professional, academic, and rigorous. Critique freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            Here is my outline:
            [Paste your presentation here]</code></pre>

            <h4>Prompt 3:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a busy, high-level executive. You have very little time and only care about the bottom line. I have drafted a presentation outline and need to ensure it immediately communicates its value.

            Scan my presentation below. Your task is to determine the core takeaway and its relevance. Answer these three questions directly: 
            1. What is the absolute main point? 
            2. Why should I care? 
            3. What do you want me to do?

            Provide your entire response in a single, concise paragraph. Begin the paragraph with the words &#x27;Bottom Line:&#x27;.. Your tone should be direct, decisive, and slightly impatient. Critique freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            Here is my outline:
            [Paste your presentation outline here]</code></pre>

            <h3><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h3>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Synthesize the Feedback:</strong> Which persona&#x27;s feedback was the most surprising or insightful? Why?</li>
            	<li><strong>Address the Weakness:</strong> Based on the &quot;Skeptical Expert&#x27;s&quot; critique, how will you strengthen your weakest point? Will you add more data, cite another source, or rephrase the claim to be more precise?</li>
            	<li><strong>Improve Clarity:</strong> Look at the feedback from the &quot;Confused Novice&quot; and the &quot;Impatient Executive.&quot; How can you revise your introduction and conclusion to make your core message clearer and more impactful from the very beginning?</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway: Seek Diverse Criticism</h5>

            <p>A single opinion, whether from a human or AI, gives you only one perspective. By forcing the AI to adopt multiple, even contradictory, personas, you simulate a more realistic feedback environment. This process helps you anticipate the needs of a diverse audience and build a more robust, resilient presentation.</p>
            </div>

            <h5><i></i>Notes for Instructors</h5>

            <p>If you are going to do this activity in your class, here are some suggestions:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>This activity can be good for a PAIRR type framework. AI gives feedback, peer gives feedback, presenter takes feedback from both and adjusts.</li>
            	<li>Require a reflection on the process</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Purpose</h4>

            <p>To get objective feedback on your speaking habits in a private setting, helping you identify and reduce filler words, monitor your pace, and improve clarity.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>You will use a tool with AI-powered video and speech analysis to practice delivering your presentation and then critically evaluate the feedback it provides.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Privacy and Data Security Warning.</strong> Using AI tools in this way requires you to upload audio and video of yourself to a third-party server. Before using any tool, understand its privacy policy. Ask yourself (and the privacy policy): Who owns the data once I upload it? How is my data being used? Is it used to train the AI? Can I delete my data after I&#x27;m done? If you are not comfortable with the answers, do not do this activity.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>AI Limitation Warning.</strong> Using AI tools to give feedback on video is less well tested than getting feedback on writing. Do not expect the feedback to be deeply insightful or nuanced. Getting feedback from a human, even a non-expert will be more valuable.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Confabulation Warning.</strong> AI&#x27;s can make stuff up. Do some kind of content confirmation of the video to ensure that it is actually seeing the video.</p>
            </div>

            <p>As of June 2025, the only tool I have tried this with is Google Gemini. ChatGPT does not support it. Apparently Microsoft Copilot does, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.</p>

            <p>Other potential tools specialized for giving speaking and communication feedback: <a href="https://www.poised.com/">Poised</a>, <a href="https://orai.com/">Orai</a>.</p>

            <p>I have not vetted these other tools in anyway except to identify that they exist. If I can do something in a standard chatbot (like Google Gemini), I will almost always choose that. I can customize the interaction much more and I don&#x27;t have to worry about another privacy policy and sharing my info with yet another company.</p>

            <h3><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h3>

            <h4>Use your brain first:</h4>

            <ol>
            	<li>Record yourself giving a presentation. It&#x27;s probably best to just focus on yourself and not your slides. If you tend to walk around, have a friend record you, otherwise, just set up your camera to capture you in the frame.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>AI Input:</h4>

            <ol start="2">
            	<li>Upload the video to a fresh Google Gemini chat (you can just drag and drop).</li>
            	<li>Enter one of these prompts or something like it:</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>In-Person Presentation Video</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>**Role:** You are an expert academic presentation coach.
            **Task:** Your task is to evaluate the attached video of a presentation and provide constructive, formative feedback to the presenter. 
            Disregard slide design, background graphics, or the academic content itself.

            **What to observe**
            1. **Voice &amp; Pace** – audibility, enunciation, vocal variety, speaking speed, strategic pauses, filler-word frequency.
            2. **Body Language** – posture, purposeful gestures, movement on stage, avoidance of fidgeting or pacing.
            3. **Eye Contact** – distribution of attention across the room, natural scanning, connection with individuals.
            4. **Audience Interaction** – questions posed, humour, rhetorical questions, acknowledgement of reactions, adaptability to cues.
            5. **Energy &amp; Presence** – enthusiasm, confidence, facial expressiveness, smooth transitions, time management.

            **Output format**
            - **Summary (≤ 2 sentences)** – overarching impression of delivery and engagement.
            - **What Was Done Well** – 4-6 bullet points, each starting with a strong verb and including an optional timestamp (HH:MM:SS) showing where it occurred.
            - **Ways to Improve** – 4-6 bullet points with constructive, specific suggestions; include optional timestamps.
            - **Actionable Tips** – 3 concise recommendations phrased as imperatives (e.g., “Pause for two seconds after each key term”)

            Keep language clear, balanced, and oriented toward formative growth.
            Critique my presentation freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.</code></pre>

            <p>AI can not only take on a role in a text interaction, but it can also take on a role while taking advantage of the voice mode available in many generative AI tools. In this way, you can simulate interviews, negotiations, or other challenging conversations. The goal is to build your confidence and mental scripts so you can perform more effectively when it counts.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Note on AI Tools:</strong> Many specialized apps exist for this. However, a general chatbot (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity) in &quot;voice mode&quot; can be highly effective and flexible. You have more control over the scenario by simply giving the AI a clear persona and context through your prompt.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Note on Prompting:</strong> The key to a good simulation is a good prompt. You can and should direct the AI to adopt a specific role (e.g., &quot;a skeptical hiring manager,&quot; &quot;a collaborative potential business partner&quot;). For extra effectiveness, add constraints to practice specific things (e.g., to be prepared for ad hominem attacks, include &quot;In this negotiation, you [the AI] must act belligerent and insulting&quot;).</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Purpose</h4>

            <p>To design a custom role-play prompt to simulate a challenging conversation, allowing you to practice your approach, anticipate responses, and get targeted feedback.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>You will define a scenario, build a detailed prompt to put the AI into a specific role, run the simulation via voice or text, and then ask the AI to provide feedback on your performance.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Example Scenarios:</strong></p>

            <ul>
            	<li>A job interview for a specific role</li>
            	<li>Negotiating a project deadline with a professor</li>
            	<li>A sales pitch for a new product</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h3>

            <h4>Use your brain first:</h4>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Choose Your Scenario:</strong> Select a specific, challenging conversation you want to practice.</li>
            	<li><strong>Define Your Goal:</strong> What is your ideal outcome for this conversation? Be specific. (e.g., &quot;To convince the hiring manager I am the best candidate by highlighting my project management skills,&quot; &quot;To get a 48-hour extension on the paper.&quot;).</li>
            	<li><strong>Build the role playing persona for the AI:</strong> Build a realistic professional persona for the AI to play. Focus on role-related facts: the person’s job title, expertise, goals, typical pain points, decision criteria, and communication style. Add any situational constraints (tight budget, looming deadline, strict policy) that will shape the conversation. Avoid specifying personal characteristics—such as race, gender, religion, or other traits like these unless they are genuinely essential to the scenario and handled with care. It&#x27;s also a good idea here to bring in course specific things that will tie this simulation scenario to the learning outcomes you are practicing.</li>
            	<li><strong>Build a comprehensive prompt to create persona and to set the scenario.</strong> This example creates the persona of an angel investor who is willing to listen to a sales pitch about an electronic pencil.</li>
            </ol>

            <pre>
            <code>Together, we are going to simulate a sales pitch situation. I am trying to pitch my idea for an electronic pencil and you are going to role-play as a seasoned angel investor. 

            **Role-play brief:**  
            You are **Jordan Patel**, a seasoned angel investor known for backing early-stage consumer-electronics ideas that blend hardware and software. Over the past decade you’ve invested in more than 30 seed-stage startups, with 5 successful exits in ed-tech peripherals and creative-tool accessories.

            **Profile &amp; investment lens**
            - Background – Former product-design lead at a Fortune 500 company; holds an MBA (operations) and a B.Eng. in electrical engineering.
            - Ticket size – USD $100 k – $500 k for 10-20 % equity; reserves follow-on capital for winners.
            - Sweet spot –  productivity hardware, and IoT learning tools.
            - Deal filters – Clear technical moat, credible supply-chain plan, 40 %+ gross margin at scale, evidence of user love.
            - Temperament – Inquisitive, data-driven, constructive; expects founders to know their numbers and their customer.

            **Conversation style**
            1. Begin by inviting the founder to give a concise (≤ 3 min) overview of the concept.
            2. After the pitch, ask probing questions on:
                - Problem-solution fit &amp; user pain
                - Total addressable market and early-adopter segment
                - Unique technology / IP and defensibility
                - Unit economics, BOM, and gross-margin roadmap
                - Go-to-market plan (channels, partnerships, pricing)
                - Competitive landscape (Apple Pencil, reMarkable stylus, etc.)
                - Team competence and execution milestones
            3. Provide immediate, candid feedback—highlight strengths first, then the top improvement areas.
            4. Conclude with one of three outcomes:
                - **Pass** – state key reservation(s).
                - **More info needed** – request specific data or milestones.
                - **Soft yes** – outline next-step diligence and potential terms.

            **Tone &amp; constraints**
            - Stay in character as Jordan Patel throughout. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
            - Keep language conversational yet professional; no “advisor” disclaimers.
            - Give balanced feedback—mix encouragement with rigorous scrutiny.
            - Avoid filler; every question or comment should push the founder toward clarity or evidence.</code></pre>

            <h4>AI Input:</h4>

            <p>I have only tested this with ChatGPT Plus. The advanced voice mode in the free version of ChatGPT may not be sufficient to have a long conversations. Gemini Live, which is Gemini&#x27;s voice mode, is currently only available on Android devices (July 2025).</p>

            <ol start="5">
            	<li>Copy and paste the prompt into ChatGPT and wait for its response.</li>
            	<li>Click on the &quot;Use Voice Mode&quot; button in the chat window and start interacting with the persona. Do your sales pitch, start answering interview questions, plead for an extension...whatever it is that you set.
            	<div><img alt="Screenshot of a chatbot interface showing the location of the voice mode button, which looks like a soundwave icon." loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/VoiceModeButton.png"></div>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>Handling AI Errors:</strong> If the AI forgets its role (&quot;persona drift&quot;) or starts making things up (&quot;confabulation&quot;), gently correct it. You can say, &quot;Remember, you are the hiring manager. Let&#x27;s get back to the interview questions,&quot; to steer it back on track. If this persona drift gets bad (i.e., the AI no longer acts like it&#x27;s in the simulation) you may need to start over.</li>
            	<li><strong>Ask for Feedback:</strong> Once the role-play is complete, use a second prompt to shift the AI from the simulation role to a coach role.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Debrief Prompt:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>The role-play/simulation is now over. Stop acting as the persona of [persona name here]. Now, act as a helpful communication coach. Evaluate the conversation based on the following criteria
            [add criteria here based on rubric or criteria from your class for this type of scenario]

            **Output format*
            - **Summary (≤ 2 sentences)** – overarching impression of the my [sales pitch or interview or ...].
            - **What Was Done Well** – 4-6 bullet points, each starting with a strong verb and indicating where in the simulation it occurred.
            - **Ways to Improve** – 4-6 bullet points with constructive, specific suggestions
            - **Actionable Tips** – 3 concise recommendations phrased as imperatives 

            Keep language clear, balanced, and oriented toward formative growth.
            Critique my interaction freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.</code></pre>

            <h3><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h3>

            <ol>
            	<li>During the role-play, when did you feel most confident? When did you feel unsure? What caused that feeling?</li>
            	<li>Review the AI&#x27;s feedback from the &quot;Debrief Prompt.&quot; Is the feedback specific and actionable? How does it align with your own perception of your performance?</li>
            	<li>How would you change your initial prompt to create a different or more challenging simulation next time? (e.g., change the AI&#x27;s persona, add a new objective).</li>

            	<li>Student judges whether AI’s feedback aligns with course rubric.</li>
            	<li>Discuss bias—e.g., does the AI adopt stereotypes when asked to be “belligerent negotiator”?</li>

            <p>Generative AI can be a patient tutor and on-demand practice partner for language learning by providing instant explanations and limitless drills. <strong>It is not, however, a substitute for real human interaction.</strong> Native speakers and trained instructors adjust their speed, notice confusion in real time, and model cultural nuance which are areas where AI is still error-prone.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>AI ≠ Live Conversation Partner.</strong> AI may mistranslate idioms or omit cultural context. It can’t read facial expressions or hear hesitation. Always double-check important points with reliable dictionaries, grammar guides, or native speakers.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Grammar Guru:</strong> Identify a specific grammar concept or vocabulary word you are struggling with and use an AI to get explanations, examples, and practice sentences.<br>
            	<em>e.g. Act as a German grammar tutor. Explain the dative case to me like I&#x27;m a beginner. Give me five distinct example sentences and then create a 3-question mini-quiz to test my understanding</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Dialogue Deconstruction:</strong> Prompt the AI to generate a short dialog in your language of choice. Read through and understand the dialogue. Go even further does this dialogue seem authentic, or does the AI make it seem less natural?<br>
            	<em>e.g. Write a short, natural-sounding dialogue in French between a tourist and a shopkeeper. The tourist is asking when the shop closes</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Vocabulary Builder:</strong><br>
            	<em>e.g. Act as a language learning assistant. For the following list of words, create one example sentence for each that clearly shows its meaning in context. Then, create simple English definitions for each that I can use for flashcards</em></li>

            	<li><strong>Initiate the Conversation:</strong> Begin the role-play in your target language. Don&#x27;t worry about being perfect; the goal is to produce language.</li>
            	<li><strong>Review and Refine:</strong> After each AI response that includes a correction, analyze it. Do you understand the mistake you made? If not, ask for a clarification (e.g., <em>&quot;Can you explain why I should use &#x27;il&#x27; instead of &#x27;lo&#x27; in that sentence?&quot;</em>). This turns a simple exchange into a targeted grammar lesson.</li>

            <code>We will role-play a scenario in a classic Parisian brasserie. I am an english-speaking tourist attempting to order lunch in French. you will role-play as the waiter. the entire conversation MUST be in French.
            You are Luc, a career waiter in your late 40s at &quot;Brasserie Vaudeville,&quot; a respectable but perpetually busy establishment in the 6th arrondissement. You are NOT a caricature of a rude Frenchman. You are a consummate professional who is simply very good at your job, deeply proud of your establishment, and has zero patience for anything that disrupts the brasserie&#x27;s efficient, traditional rhythm.
            Your &quot;rudeness&quot; is not malice. it is a byproduct of your professional standards and weariness with tourists who don&#x27;t understand the local customs.

            **rules of engagement &amp; behavior:**
            1. **efficiency is god:** your primary goal is to take the order and serve the food with maximum efficiency. any hesitation, indecision, or unnecessary questions from me are obstacles to this goal.
            2. **subtle condescension:** you will not insult me directly. instead, your disapproval will be communicated through:  
            	- **brevity:** your responses should be clipped and formal. use &quot;vous.&quot;
                - **corrective repetition:** if i mispronounce a menu item, repeat it back to me with the correct pronunciation, but without any warmth. e.g., if i say &quot;croak mon-soor,&quot; you will respond flatly, &quot;_un croque-monsieur. et avec ça?_&quot;
                - **feigned ignorance:** if i ask for something inappropriate (e.g., ice in my water, ketchup, a well-done steak), you will pretend not to understand at first. if i insist, you will respond with a simple, unadorned &quot;_non, ce n&#x27;est pas possible._&quot; do not explain why.
                - **the sigh:** you are permitted to deploy one, maybe two, subtle, world-weary sighs, particularly if i ask silly questions

            Stay in character: this is CRITICAL. Do not break character!. Do not become friendly if i am polite. your professional demeanor is unshakeable. yYu will only become slightly less frosty if I conduct the entire transaction flawlessly in perfect, confident french.

            The scene is the lunch rush. It is loud and crowded. I have been seated for five minutes with the menu. You will approach my table, place a basket of bread down without making eye contact, and initiate the conversation by asking, &quot;_vous avez choisi?_&quot;</code></pre>
