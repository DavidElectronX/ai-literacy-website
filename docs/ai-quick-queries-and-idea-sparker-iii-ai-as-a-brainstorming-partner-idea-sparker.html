              Now let's explore how AI can help generate ideas. The focus here is on using specific prompting techniques to encourage more creative or unconventional outputs, while still maintaining a critical eye and remembering that AI is a tool to augment your own thinking.

                    <p>
                      Imagine you need to brainstorm ideas for an essay topic, a project proposal, or even just discussion points for class.

                    <p>
                      Give an AI tool your area of interest (e.g., 'climate change solutions for urban areas,' 'themes in Shakespeare's Hamlet,' 'applications of calculus in biology'). Ask it to generate a list of 5-10 related ideas, subtopics, or questions to explore. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                      This resulted in some pretty wild prompts, including this one (feel free to adapt or use it as inspiration):

                                      <code>Imagine you are **'The Oracle of Unseen Possibilities,'** an ancient, playful entity that perceives connections and futures invisible to ordinary minds. You are not bound by current technology, budgets, or societal norms.

                I am seeking radically innovative ideas for: **[Clearly and concisely describe your product, research area, or problem here. E.g., 'a new way for communities to manage and share local food resources,' or 'a research project to understand the long-term cognitive effects of immersive virtual realities,' or 'a solution to urban loneliness in hyper-connected cities.']**

                Your task is to provide **at least 10-15 'Visions' (ideas)**. These Visions must be:
                - **Paradigm-Shifting:** They should challenge fundamental assumptions about the problem or domain.
                - **Fantastically Novel:** Think beyond incremental improvements. Aim for ideas that would make someone say, 'I never would have thought of that in a million years!'
                - **Metaphorically Rich:** To spark your unique perspective, consider this analogy: If this problem were a **[choose a highly abstract or fantastical concept, e.g., 'a tangled constellation needing re-alignment,' or 'a silent song waiting to be heard,' or 'a forgotten flavor that needs rediscovering']**, what would the solutions look like in that realm? How can those metaphorical solutions inspire tangible, albeit audacious, ideas in our world?
                - **Evocatively Described:** Briefly explain each Vision in a way that ignites imagination, even if the mechanics are speculative.

                **Crucially, avoid:**
                - Obvious or common solutions.
                - Minor variations of existing concepts.
                - Ideas constrained by current feasibility.

It should be a physical good, not a service or software. I'd like a product that could be sold at a retail price of less than about USD 50. The ideas are just ideas. The product need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be clearly feasible. 

                Follow these steps. Do each step, even if you think you do not need to. 
                First generate a list of 100 ideas (short title only) 
                Second, go through the list and determine whether the ideas are different and bold, modify the ideas as needed to make them bolder and more different. No two ideas should be the same. This is important! 
                Next, give the ideas a name and combine it with a product description. The name and idea are separated by a colon and followed by a description. The idea should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. Do this step by step!</code></pre>

                      For a topic you're studying, ask AI to generate a few "what if" scenarios related to it. For example: "What if this historical event hadn't happened?" or "What if this scientific principle was discovered 100 years earlier?"

                    <p>
                      Your turn! Try a basic "what if" prompt. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                                      <code>What if the internet had been invented in 1900 instead of the late 20th century? Generate three plausible scenarios for its impact on World War I.</code></pre>
                    <p>
                      Consider trying some of the advanced prompting techniques from Activity 2 (like assigning a persona or specific constraints) to get even more interesting (or more bizarre) "what if" scenarios.

                        How accurate or plausible are the AI's extrapolations in these scenarios? (This connects to evaluating AI's limitations in reasoning and understanding complex causality). Are the connections logical, or do they seem superficial or based on common tropes?

                      AI can be a playful and stimulating tool for imaginative exploration and generating "what if" scenarios. However, always ground its outputs in factual knowledge and critical reasoning. Assess the plausibility and logical coherence of its scenarios rather than accepting them at face value.
