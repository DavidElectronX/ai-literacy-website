            <p><strong><i></i>Your First and Most Important Step: Check Your Course Policy</strong></p>

            <p>Before using any idea from this module for an assignment, you must understand your instructor&#x27;s specific AI policy. Seriously. Print it out. Write it on your hand. Set it as your phone wallpaper. Violating the policy doesn&#x27;t just risk academic consequences—it undermines the very reason you&#x27;re here: to learn. This module shows you what&#x27;s possible with AI, but your instructor&#x27;s guidelines are the final word on what&#x27;s permissible.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Just like learning, writing is hard. Like, &quot;staring at a blank page for three hours while eating your body weight in snacks&quot; hard. But it&#x27;s supposed to be. That struggle is your brain doing the work. While AI can generate flawless-looking text in seconds, it skips the most important part: the mental workout. The real value of writing isn&#x27;t just the finished text; it&#x27;s the thinking you do to get there.</p>

            <p>Writing is how you:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Solidify what you think:</strong> It forces you to organize the chaos in your brain into a coherent argument.</li>
            	<li><strong>Express who you are:</strong> It gives a platform to your unique experiences, insights, and voice.</li>
            	<li><strong>Build a crucial life skill:</strong> Thinking and communicating clearly is a superpower you&#x27;ll need long after you graduate.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The good news? Writing gets easier (or at least less painful) when you make it purposeful. </p>

            <h2>How Your Instructor Might Approach AI:</h2>
            <p>Your instructor&#x27;s policy will likely fall into one of these three broad categories, though the specific details will vary. That&#x27;s why reading the exact policy on your syllabus is so important.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>&quot;No AI Allowed&quot;</strong><br>
            	Honor this stance. Your instructor has good reasons: ensuring you do the thinking, exercising your writing muscles, and developing your authentic voice. Think of it as intellectual cross-fit—painful but building essential strength. You&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunities to use AI in other contexts.</li>
            	<li><strong>&quot;Limited AI Use&quot;</strong><br>
            	If your instructor allows specific uses, make the most of them and put some thought into how best to use AI:
            	<ul>
            		<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Use good prompting to explore ideas (not generate them for you).</li>
            		<li><strong>Editing Feedback:</strong> Input course materials, rubrics, and assignment details to get targeted suggestions.</li>
            		<li><strong>Revision Support:</strong> Get specific feedback on clarity, structure, or style—but do the rewriting yourself.</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>&quot;AI as a Collaborative Tool&quot;</strong><br>
            	Some instructors encourage using AI to generate initial drafts that you then critically evaluate and revise, or to review your writing and reflect on the feedback. This approach treats AI as a thinking partner, not a substitute for thinking.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Regardless of the level of AI work you are permitted to use, the goal of this module isn&#x27;t to help you avoid the hard work of writing. It&#x27;s to show you how to use AI to make that hard work more productive, insightful, and even fun. Let&#x27;s get started.</p>
