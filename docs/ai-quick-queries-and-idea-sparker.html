              You've got the overview of AI's potential and pitfalls from the
              <em>
                <strong>

              section. Now, it's time to get hands-on again! In this section, "AI Quick Queries & Idea Sparker," we'll explore some initial ways you can use AI for your studies (help explain things and brainstorm).
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of this as your AI sandbox – a place to experiment, learn, and build your critical AI literacy skills.

            <h3>
              Your Guiding Principles for This Exploration
            </h3>
            <p>
              As you work through the activities in this tab, let these key ideas guide your approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Be an Active Experimenter:
                </strong>
                Don't just passively receive information from AI. Get in there, try different prompts, and see what happens! Each activity is a chance for you to "do something" with AI.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  It's Okay to Start Small (Low Stakes, High Learning):
                </strong>
                The tasks here are designed to be introductory. If AI makes a mistake (and it will!), it's a low-risk opportunity for you to spot it and learn about AI's limitations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Put on Your Critical Thinking Hat – Always:
                </strong>
                This is the most important part! After every AI interaction, we'll prompt you to "Pause & Ponder." This is where you'll connect back to the limitations we discussed in the
                <em>
                  <strong>
                    Essentials
                  </strong>
                </em>
                section and analyze the AI's output. Is it accurate? Biased? Superficial?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Build Your "AI Detective" Skills:
                </strong>
                Our goal is to help you become confident in your ability to use AI critically. By practicing how to spot errors, question outputs, and guide AI more effectively, you'll learn that
                <em>
                  you
                </em>
                are the one in control.
