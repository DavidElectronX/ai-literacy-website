<p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that normally required human intelligence, such as interpreting language, recognizing patterns from large amounts of data, and making decisions. Some of the names given to AI, based on the way in which it is designed and what it can do, include neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine learning, and deep learning.</p>

<p>While we tend to think of it as a product of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it has been around since the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Chances are good that you interact with AI every day. Examples of AI include:</p>

<p>AI has been around in education for decades, usually embedded as part of the student management system or the learning management system. These sorts of AI monitored student engagements with their platforms and analyzed large amounts of data to predict which student was likely to succeed or withdraw from a course (and therefore which ones might benefit from additional support), and how to optimize and personalize learning.</p>
