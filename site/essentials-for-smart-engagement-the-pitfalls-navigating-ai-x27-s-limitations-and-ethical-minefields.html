            <p>Generative AI offers exciting possibilities, but it&#x27;s important to understand that it is a tool with limitations and ethical challenges. AI is not infallible, nor is it human; it doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; or &quot;know&quot; things in the way people do. Think of it as a powerful but sometimes unreliable assistant. Adopting a &quot;trust, but verify&quot; mindset is essential. This means critically evaluating everything AI produces and being aware of the potential pitfalls before you dive in.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="the-accuracy-mirage-hallucinations--misinformation">The Accuracy Mirage: Hallucinations &amp; Misinformation</h3>

            <div><img alt="The word facts, but question marks surround it" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/facts_widescreen.png"></div>

            <p>AI can generate responses that sound completely confident and authoritative, but are actually incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely made up. These are often called &quot;hallucinations&quot; (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5127162">although I prefer the term &quot;mirage&quot;</a>). Because AI models are designed to predict the next most likely word or pixel, not to access a database of verified facts, they can inadvertently create plausible-sounding misinformation.</p>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Always cross-reference AI-generated information with reliable sources</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i> Quick Activity</h4>

            <p>Ask an AI to explain a complex niche topic you know well. Does it get the details right? Where does it falter?Â </p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="the-bias-blindspot-ai-reflecting--amplifying-prejudices">The Bias Blindspot: AI Reflecting &amp; Amplifying Prejudices</h3>

            <div><img alt="A visual of diverse data points (some perhaps subtly colored/shaped differently to represent bias) being fed into an AI &#x27;black box&#x27;, which then outputs content predominantly reflecting those biased colors/shapes" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/AI_input_output_blackbox_small.png"></div>

            <p>AI models learn from enormous amounts of text and image data, much of which is created by humans and reflects existing societal biases related to race, gender, age, nationality, and more. As a result, AI outputs can unintentionally perpetuate or even amplify these prejudices, leading to skewed, unfair, or stereotypical responses. Be critical of AI outputs that seem to generalize or rely on stereotypes.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i> Quick Activity</h4>

            <p>The easiest way to see bias is to ask an AI image generator to make an image of a professional where that professional is stereotypically one gender.<br>
            e.g., &quot;create a picture of a nurse&quot;</p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="privacy-on-the-line-your-data--ai">Privacy on the Line: Your Data &amp; AI</h3>

            <div><img alt="A padlock icon ðŸ”’ with a crack in it, or a visual of data (represented by bits or files) flowing into a &#x27;cloud&#x27; server with a large question mark hovering over it." loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/bits_flowing_to_q_mark_small.png"></div>

            <p>When you interact with many publicly available AI tools, the information you input (your prompts, your questions, your uploaded documents) can be collected, stored, and potentially used to train future versions of the AI or for other purposes by the company providing the tool.</p>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Never input sensitive personal information, confidential data (e.g., unpublished research, proprietary business information), or anything you wouldn&#x27;t want to become public.</strong> Always check the AI tool&#x27;s privacy policy if you have concerns.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i> Quick Activity</h4>

            <p>Download the privacy policy from a chatbot (e.g., <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/">ChatGPT</a>), upload it to a chatbot and prompt:</p>

            <p><em>&quot;Analyze this privacy policy for how it addresses user data collection, storage, and sharing practices. Evaluate the clarity, transparency, and user control offered, especially in the context of AI-generated content&quot;</em></p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="the-ethical-tightrope-academic-integrity--responsible-use">The Ethical Tightrope: Academic Integrity &amp; Responsible Use</h3>

            <div><img alt=" A classic balance scale, with &quot;AI Assistance&quot; on one side and &quot;Your Own Work &amp; Ideas&quot; on the other, with &quot;Academic Integrity&quot; written on the beam of the scale" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/AI_vs_YourOwnWork.png"></div>

            <p>Using AI to help you brainstorm or understand concepts is one thing, but submitting AI-generated work as your own is a serious breach of academic integrity, equivalent to plagiarism. Your university&#x27;s policies on academic honesty apply to the use of AI tools. Beyond plagiarism, be aware that AI can also be misused to create harmful content, such as deepfakes or misinformation campaigns.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="whose-idea-is-it-anyway-intellectual-property--copyright">Whose Idea Is It Anyway? Intellectual Property &amp; Copyright</h3>

            <div><img alt="The copyright symbol Â© with a large question mark superimposed or next to it, or a collage of images/text with some faded/watermarked to suggest unclear ownership" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/copyright_question_mark_small.png"></div>

            <p>AI models are trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted materials like books, articles, and artwork. This raises complex questions about intellectual property. The content AI generates may not be truly &quot;original&quot; and could sometimes resemble or incorporate elements of existing copyrighted works. The legal landscape around AI and copyright is still evolving, so be cautious about using AI-generated content, especially images or music, in public or commercial projects without understanding potential restrictions.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 id="the-hidden-costs-environmental--societal-impact">The Hidden Costs: Environmental &amp; Societal Impact</h3>

            <div><img alt="AI next to a power plant spewing CO2" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/AI_and_emissions_small.png"></div>

            <p>Generative AI is poised to reshape society in many ways. Here&#x27;s a rundown of some key social impacts, bearing in mind that many of these are interconnected and still evolving:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Job Displacement</strong></li>
            	<li><strong>Security Threats</strong></li>
            	<li><strong>Privacy Erosion</strong></li>
            	<li><strong>Mental Well-being</strong></li>
            	<li><strong>Cultural Homogenization</strong></li>
            	<li><strong>Environmental Strain</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Being an informed AI user includes an awareness of these broader impacts.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3 id="the-crutch-danger-over-reliance--skill-atrophy">The Danger of the Crutch: Over-Reliance &amp; Skill Atrophy</h3>

            <div><img alt="Boyfriend distracted by Generative AI. Critical thinking is angry" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/distracted_boyfriend.png"></div>

            <p>While AI can be a helpful assistant, relying on it too heavily can prevent you from developing your own critical thinking, problem-solving, and writing skills. If AI always provides the answer or drafts your text, you miss out on the valuable learning process of grappling with challenges yourself. Strive for a balance where AI supports your learning, rather than becoming a crutch that hinders it.</p>
