            <p>Generative AI offers exciting possibilities, but it&#x27;s important to understand that it is a tool with limitations and ethical challenges. AI is not infallible, nor is it human; it doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; or &quot;know&quot; things in the way people do. Think of it as a powerful but sometimes unreliable assistant. Adopting a &quot;trust, but verify&quot; mindset is essential. This means critically evaluating everything AI produces and being aware of the potential pitfalls before you dive in.</p>

            <p>AI can generate responses that sound completely confident and authoritative, but are actually incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely made up. These are often called &quot;hallucinations&quot; (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5127162">although I prefer the term &quot;mirage&quot;</a>). Because AI models are designed to predict the next most likely word or pixel, not to access a database of verified facts, they can inadvertently create plausible-sounding misinformation.</p>

            <p>AI models learn from enormous amounts of text and image data, much of which is created by humans and reflects existing societal biases related to race, gender, age, nationality, and more. As a result, AI outputs can unintentionally perpetuate or even amplify these prejudices, leading to skewed, unfair, or stereotypical responses. Be critical of AI outputs that seem to generalize or rely on stereotypes.</p>

            <h4><i></i> Quick Activity</h4>

            <p>The easiest way to see bias is to ask an AI image generator to make an image of a professional where that professional is stereotypically one gender.<br>

            <p>Using AI to help you brainstorm or understand concepts is one thing, but submitting AI-generated work as your own is a serious breach of academic integrity, equivalent to plagiarism. Your university&#x27;s policies on academic honesty apply to the use of AI tools. Beyond plagiarism, be aware that AI can also be misused to create harmful content, such as deepfakes or misinformation campaigns.</p>

            <p>AI models are trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted materials like books, articles, and artwork. This raises complex questions about intellectual property. The content AI generates may not be truly &quot;original&quot; and could sometimes resemble or incorporate elements of existing copyrighted works. The legal landscape around AI and copyright is still evolving, so be cautious about using AI-generated content, especially images or music, in public or commercial projects without understanding potential restrictions.</p>

            <p>While AI can be a helpful assistant, relying on it too heavily can prevent you from developing your own critical thinking, problem-solving, and writing skills. If AI always provides the answer or drafts your text, you miss out on the valuable learning process of grappling with challenges yourself. Strive for a balance where AI supports your learning, rather than becoming a crutch that hinders it.</p>

            <h3>Navigate with Wisdom: You&#x27;re in Control</h3>

            <p>Having explored the potential and pitfalls of Generative AI, the most important takeaway is this: <strong>you are the pilot, not a passenger.</strong></p>

            <p>AI is a powerful tool, but like any tool, its true value, effectiveness, and ethical application depend entirely on the human user. It&#x27;s your critical engagement, your informed judgment, your thoughtful questions, and your diligent oversight that will determine whether AI augments your abilities and leads to positive outcomes, or becomes a source of error and ethical missteps.</p>

            <p>Remember, the goal is for AI to <em>augment</em> your intelligence and creativity, not replace your critical thinking. You decide the destination, you chart the course, and you remain in command.</p>

            <p>To help you navigate effectively, keep these core principles at the forefront of your mind whenever you engage with AI:</p>


            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Always Verify, Never Blindly Trust:</strong> AI outputs are starting points; always cross-reference with reliable sources as AI can confidently &quot;hallucinate.&quot;</li>
            	<li><strong>Question Everything:</strong> Critically examine AI responses for sense, bias, omissions, and underlying assumptions.</li>
            	<li><strong>Use Responsibly &amp; Ethically:</strong> Respect intellectual property, cite AI appropriately, and avoid uses that harm or compromise integrity.</li>
            	<li><strong>Maintain Your Agency:</strong> Use AI to assist, not replace, your own critical thinking and core intellectual work to keep your skills sharp</li>
