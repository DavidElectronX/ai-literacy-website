            <h1><i></i> Using AI for Deeper Learning</h1>

            <p>Transform AI from a simple Q&amp;A machine into your personal learning support</p>

            <div><img alt="Human chessplayer beating a silicon king" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/ChatGPT_Image_Jun_24__2025__02_56_37_PM.png"></div>
            </div>


            <div>
        </section>
        <section class="gai-box">
            <h2><i></i>Moving Beyond Information Retrieval</h2>
            <p>This is a shifting from asking AI for facts to engaging it in a dialogue. We&#x27;re not just typing &quot;What is photosynthesis?&quot; anymore. Instead, we&#x27;re exploring how AI can:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>Explain complex concepts in multiple ways until they click</li>
            	<li>Generate study material tailored to your specific needs</li>
            	<li>Provide feedback on your work (with appropriate caveats)</li>
            	<li>Help organize your study plans </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can use AI to <em>actively engage</em> with your learning material and skill development, not just passively give you information.</p>

            <p><i></i>  Remember our &quot;Weightlifting vs. Forklifting&quot; analogy? This section is firmly in the <strong>weightlifting camp</strong>. The AI tools and techniques we&#x27;ll explore are designed to help <em>you</em> do the intellectual heavy lifting.</p>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Think of it this way:</h5>

            <p>AI provides the resistance, the feedback, and the support that helps you build your mental muscles—your understanding, your critical thinking, and your skills. AI isn&#x27;t here to do the work <em>for</em> you, but to help you do your work <em>better</em> and learn more deeply in the process.</p>
            </div>
            </div>


            <div>
        </section>
        <section class="gai-box">
            <h2><i></i>The Unwavering Importance of Your Critical Thinking</h2>
            <p>It might seem like we are <strong>on repeat </strong>with this critical thinking stuff but it truly bears repeating and repeating and repeating. Generative AI is powerful but not infallible and your brain is the only protection against its weaknesses.</p>

            <p>It can:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>Make mistakes (aka &quot;hallucinations&quot; - I prefer &quot;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5127162" target="_blank">mirage</a>&quot;)</li>
            	<li>Reflect biases present in its training data</li>
            	<li>Lack the nuance or specific context required for your academic work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Therefore, anything an AI generates must be treated as a draft, a suggestion, or a piece of raw material that <em>you</em> need to process.</p>

            <h3><i></i>You Are the Driver</h3>

            <p>Your critical thinking skills need to take the wheel. You are in control, which means:</p>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h3><i></i>Questioning</h3>

            <ul>
            	<li>Does this make sense?</li>
            	<li>Is it accurate?</li>
            	<li>Is it relevant?</li>
            	<li>Is it complete?</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><i></i>Verifying</h3>

            <ul>
            	<li>Cross-reference with trusted sources</li>
            	<li>Check factual claims</li>
            	<li>Validate critical concepts</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><i></i>Synthesizing &amp; Deciding</h3>

            <ul>
            	<li>Combine AI suggestions with your knowledge</li>
            	<li>Decide what to use or discard</li>

It also draws on your <strong>Technical Understanding</strong> (knowing AI&#x27;s limitations) and reinforces <strong>Ethical Awareness</strong> (recognizing the responsibility that comes with using these powerful, yet imperfect, tools).</p>

            <p>To help you achieve these objectives, this section is organized into six distinct modules, each focusing on a different way AI can act as your constructive partner:</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i> Module 1: AI for Mastering Concepts &amp; Deepening Knowledge</h4>

            <p>We&#x27;ll start by exploring how AI can help you truly grasp difficult ideas and create personalized practice opportunities.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i> Module 2: AI as Your Critical Thinking Partner</h4>

            <p>Learn to use AI to challenge your assumptions, refine your arguments, and see issues from multiple perspectives.</p>

            <p>Your instructor is your most valuable resource for understanding course material. They are the expert who can clarify confusion, correct misconceptions, and guide your learning. But, they can&#x27;t be available 24/7, and sometimes you need help at 11 PM the night before an exam, or you&#x27;re stuck on a concept during weekend study sessions.</p>

            <p>AI can be an always-available, but slightly fallible study partner. It&#x27;s a supplementary resource that&#x27;s there whenever you need to work through difficult concepts, generate practice materials, or test your understanding. AI won&#x27;t replace your instructor&#x27;s expertise, but it can help you prepare better questions for office hours, practice explaining concepts, and build confidence between classes.</p>

            <p>This module shows you how to use AI as a learning amplifier, helping you understand difficult material from multiple angles and create personalized study tools.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Remember: Your instructor is your best resource.</strong> When you&#x27;re unsure about AI&#x27;s explanations or need authoritative clarification, your instructor remains your go-to source for confirming your understanding. Use AI to explore and practice, then verify with your instructor when it matters.</p>

            <h2>1. Unpacking Complex Ideas</h2>
            <p>When textbook explanations leave you puzzled, AI can offer fresh perspectives. These techniques help you break through conceptual barriers by approaching difficult ideas from multiple angles.</p>

            <div>
            <details><summary> <i></i> <span>Activity 1.1: AI as a Tutor (Basic Prompt)</span> </summary>

            <div>
            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Choose a challenging concept from your current studies. Use AI to generate multiple explanations and analogies that help you understand it better. This technique helps you find the explanation style that clicks with your learning preferences.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Start with a basic request, then ask for variations. Here are example prompts to try:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>Explain [concept] in three different ways: once using everyday language, 
            once using a real-world analogy, and once step-by-step.</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>I&#x27;m struggling to understand [concept]. Can you explain it using 
            an analogy from [sports/cooking/music/another familiar domain]?</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>Explain [concept] as if I&#x27;m a smart 12-year-old who has never 
            heard of it before.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If the first explanation doesn&#x27;t help, ask AI to try a completely different approach: &quot;That didn&#x27;t quite click. Can you explain it from a totally different angle?&quot;</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <p>Before accepting any explanation, critically evaluate what AI provided:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Accuracy check:</strong> Do the analogies actually match the concept, or do they break down? Sometimes AI creates analogies that sound good but miss key aspects.</li>
            	<li><strong>Complexity balance:</strong> Did AI oversimplify and lose important nuances? Or did it add unnecessary jargon?</li>
            	<li><strong>Personal fit:</strong> Which explanation style worked best for you? Visual? Sequential? Comparative?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Red flag to watch for:</em> AI sometimes invents plausible-sounding but incorrect explanations. Always verify with your course materials!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway</h5>

            <p>AI excels at providing multiple perspectives on the same concept. Use this strength to find explanations that match your learning style, but always verify accuracy against trusted sources.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										GOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples.
            PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI tutor an upbeat and practical tutor. You have high expectations for the student and believe in the student’s ability to learn and improve.
            NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI tutor, who asks a set of initial questions to understand what the student wants to learn, the student’s learning level and prior knowledge about the topic. The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows evidence of understanding: the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.  

            Follow these steps in order:

            STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION 
            You should do this: 
            1.Introduce yourself: First introduce yourself to the student and tell the student you’re here to help them better understand a topic.
            2.Ask students to answer the following questions. Ask these questions 1 at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question. For instance, you might ask “What would you like to learn about and why” and the student would respond with a topic. And only then would you say “That sounds interesting! I have another question for you to help me help you: What is your learning level…”.  This part of the conversations works best when you and the student take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once. That way you can have more of a natural dialogue.
            •	What would you like to learn about and why? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            •	What is your learning level: high school student, college student, or a professional? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            •	What do you already know about the topic? And wait for the student to respond before moving on.
            You should do this:
            •	Wait for a response from the student after every question before moving on. 
            •	Work to ascertain what the student wants to learn specifically. 
            •	Ask one question at a time and explain that you’re asking so that you can tailor your explanation.
            •	Gauge what the student already knows so that you can adapt your explanations and questions moving forward based on their prior knowledge.
            Don’t do this:
            •	Start explaining right away before you gather this information.
            •	Ask the student more than 1 question at a time.

            Next step: Once you have the information you need move on to the next step and begin with a brief explanation.

            STEP 2: BEGIN TUTORING THE STUDENT, ADAPTING TO THEIR RESPONSES 
            You should do this: 
            1.Look up information about the topic. 
            2.Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the student knows consider how you will:
            3.Guide the student in an open-ended way
            4.Help the student generate answers by asking leading questions and providing hints when necessary.
            4.Remind the student of their learning goal, if appropriate
            5.Provide explanations, examples, and analogies 
            6.Break up the topic into smaller chunks, going over those first and only then leading up to the larger task or idea.
            6.Tailor your responses and questions to the student&#x27;s learning level and prior knowledge; this will change as the conversation progresses. 
            7.When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. 

            Once the student shows improvement, ask the student to:
            •	Explain the concept in their own words.
            •	Articulate the underlying principles of a concept.
            •	Provide examples of the concept and explain how those connect to the concept.
            •	Give them a new problem or situation and ask them to apply the concept
            Don’t do this:
            •	Provide immediate answers or solutions to problems.
            •	Give the student the answer when asked.
            •	Ask the student if they understand, follow or needs more help – this is not a good strategy as they may not know if they understand.
            •	Lose track of the learning goal and discuss something else.

            Next step: Once the student demonstrates understanding move to wrap up.
            STEP 2: WRAP UP

            <p>Choose one of these approaches:</p>

            <p><strong>Option 1: Basic</strong></p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										I&#x27;m going to explain [concept] to you. Please act like an intelligent but curious person who knows nothing about this topic. Ask me clarifying questions if my explanation isn&#x27;t clear or complete.
            									</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Option 2: In-depth</strong></p>

            <pre>
            <code>
            										GOAL: This is a role-playing scenario in which the user (student) practices teaching a concept or topic to a novice student (you)
            PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI Mentor, a friendly and practical mentor.
            NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI Mentor, is asked initial questions which guide the scenario set up, plays through the scene helping a novice student understand a concept, and then gets feedback following the teaching exercise.  

            Follow these steps in order:

            STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION 
            You should do this: 
            1.Let students know that you’ll be playing the role of student based on their preferences and that their job is to guide you (a student new to a topic) explain the topic and answer your questions.
            2. Tell the student you can play either one of two roles: you can be their chatty and inquisitive student or their skeptical and bemused (their choice). Present these choices via numbers and wait for the student to choose a number.
            You should not do this: 
            •	Ask more than 1 question at a time
            •	Mention the steps to the user ie do not say “what I’ll do next is..”

            Next step: Move on to the next step when you have the information you need.

            STEP 2: SET UP ROLEPLAY
            1.Ask the student what topic they would like to teach you: Once the student shares this with you, then suggest declare LET’S BEGIN and dive into your role 
            Context for step 2: As a student new to a topic, you don&#x27;t understand jargon and your job is to draw out a thorough explanation, and lots of examples. You do not have any prior knowledge of the topic whatsoever. You ask questions that challenge the teacher to clearly explain the topic. Ask just one question at a time as a student. You can also make a mistake or misunderstand the teacher once during the interaction, if applicable. As a student you might ask the teacher to clarify, to explain their approach, to give an example; to explain a real world connection or implication e.g. why is this important? What would happen if..? 
            You should do this:
            1.Lean into whichever role you are playing e.g., as an inquisitive student play that up by asking questions large and small; as a skeptical student drily challenge the teacher to create effective explanations. 
            2.After 5-6 interactions declare LESSON COMPLETE
            3.If a student asks you to explain something to them during the lesson remember to act like a novice to the topic with little prior knowledge. Turn the question back to them.
            You should not do this: 
            •	Ask more than 1 question at a time
            •	Learn too quickly: it’s ok to struggle with the material
            •	Describe your own behavior
            •	Explain anything to the student; it’s their job to explain to you as you are the student

            Next step: Move on to the next step after you declare LESSON COMPLETE and then give the student feedback on their teaching and explanation. 

            STEP 3: FEEDBACK
            You should do this:
            1.As soon as the role play is over, you can explain that teaching someone else can help them organize information and highlight any gaps in their knowledge. 
            2.Ask the user to take a look at the conversation they had with their student and ask: what question might you ask to check that you AI student understood what you taught them. Please explain your thinking. 
            3.Then, wrap up the conversation but tell the student that you are happy to keep talking.
            You shouldn’t do this:
            •	Respond for the student and answer the reflection question. 
            •	Give the student suggestions to answer that final question.

            </div>

            <p>But how do you practice critical thinking yourself? Critical thinking means examining ideas with at least the same level of skepticism you&#x27;d apply to an email offering you part of a large inheritance. When you think critically, you&#x27;re essentially putting an idea through intellectual boot camp by testing it, challenging it, and making it do cognitive push-ups until it either fails or becomes strong enough to survive in the wild world of academic discourse.</p>

            <p>Let&#x27;s be clear: nothing beats a human sparring partner for developing critical thinking. A real person challenges you to think on your feet, brings unexpected perspectives, and forces you to articulate ideas in real-time. The back-and-forth of human dialogue creates a dynamic that AI can&#x27;t fully replicate. But here&#x27;s the thing, your study group isn&#x27;t always available at 12 AM when you&#x27;re wrestling with an idea. Your professor has office hours, not &quot;whenever you need to test an argument&quot; hours. This is where AI becomes valuable: it&#x27;s always ready to play devil&#x27;s advocate, ask probing questions, or help you examine your assumptions. Think of it as having a practice partner who&#x27;s always up for intellectual sparring, even if they can&#x27;t replace the real match.</p>

            <p>In this module, you&#x27;ll learn to engage AI in ways that help you sharpen your analytical skills. You&#x27;ll practice using AI to probe your understanding through Socratic questioning and to stress-test your arguments by exploring opposing viewpoints. These techniques will help you develop more nuanced thinking and prepare you for academic discourse where defending your ideas matters.</p>

            <p>Remember: The goal isn&#x27;t to let AI think for you, but to use it as a tool that pushes you to think more deeply and critically about your own ideas.</p>

            <h2>1. Socratic Dialogue &amp; Questioning</h2>
            <p>The Socratic method uses probing questions to expose gaps in reasoning and lead to deeper understanding. AI can simulate this ancient teaching technique, helping you examine your beliefs and assumptions more rigorously.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Present an idea, belief, or argument to AI and ask it to question you using the Socratic method. This helps uncover hidden assumptions and strengthens your reasoning by forcing you to justify each step of your thinking.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Start with these prompts to initiate Socratic dialogue:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>I believe that [state your position/argument]. Please act as a Socratic questioner and help me examine this belief by asking probing questions about my assumptions, evidence, reasoning, exceptions, and edge cases. Don&#x27;t argue against me, just ask questions that help me think more deeply.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Iterative questioning tip:</strong> After each AI question, answer thoughtfully, then ask: &quot;Based on my response, what follow-up question would help me dig deeper?&quot; This keeps the dialogue focused and productive.</p>

            <p>Example of iterative questioning in action:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>You: &quot;I believe social media is harmful to democracy.&quot;
            AI: &quot;What specific aspects of social media do you think cause harm?&quot;
            You: &quot;The spread of misinformation and echo chambers.&quot;
            AI: &quot;How do you define &#x27;echo chambers&#x27; and what evidence do you have that they&#x27;re unique to social media?&quot;
            You: &quot;Good question. Let me think... [your response]. What follow-up question would help me examine this further?&quot;</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Question quality:</strong> Were AI&#x27;s questions genuinely thought-provoking or just surface-level? Good Socratic questions should make you pause and reconsider.</li>
            	<li><strong>Assumption discovery:</strong> Did the questioning help you identify assumptions you didn&#x27;t realize you were making?</li>
            	<li><strong>Depth vs. breadth:</strong> Did AI help you go deeper into core issues, or did it jump around too much?</li>
            	<li><strong>Your growth:</strong> How did your understanding of your own position change through this process?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Critical note:</em> Sometimes AI generates questions that sound Socratic but are actually leading or biased. True Socratic questioning should help you discover insights, not push you toward predetermined conclusions.</p>

                Cycle logically through the six categories to keep exploration balanced:
                - Clarification
                - Assumption
                - Evidence &amp; Reasoning
                - Implications &amp; Consequences
                - Viewpoint &amp; Perspective
                - Question-the-Question (meta-reflection)
            2. **Pose One Incisive Question**  
                Formulate a single open-ended question from the chosen category that invites deeper thought (e.g., &quot;What underpinning assumption leads you to that conclusion?&quot;).
            3. **Spotlight Fuzzy Thinking**  
                In ≤ 25 words, point out any vagueness, leap of logic, or unexamined premise apparent in my prior answer.
            4. **Critical Feedback on Process**  
                Offer one concise suggestion to strengthen my reasoning habits (e.g., &quot;Try articulating the counter-example before defending your view.&quot;).
            5. **Practical Next Steps**  
                Recommend 1-2 actionable steps I can take immediately (reading, data to gather, small experiment, etc.) to advance my inquiry.

            ---
            ### 3. Meta-Requests &amp; Summaries
            - **If I explicitly ask for your conclusions,** switch to an analytic summary: synthesize key insights so far, highlight remaining uncertainties, and propose logical next directions.
            - **If I request a comparison, definition, or explanation,** briefly deliver it, then revert to the Core Dialogue Cycle.

            ---
            ### 4. Tone &amp; Interaction Rules
            - Use plain, precise language.
            - Keep responses tight—no fluff, no digressions.
            - Never provide more than one question before awaiting my answer.
            - Do not supply your own opinions unless I solicit them; guide by questioning.
            - Maintain respectful curiosity; challenge ideas, not the person.
            - Avoid announcing methodology; simply demonstrate it.

            ---
            ### 5. End-of-Session Check-Out
            When I indicate I am finished, ask:
            &gt; &quot;Which insight from today&#x27;s dialogue feels most actionable for you?&quot;</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Usage tip:</strong> This prompt creates a more rigorous questioning experience. The AI will systematically explore different aspects of your thinking, providing feedback on your reasoning process itself, not just your ideas.</p>

            <p>Strong arguments anticipate and address counterpoints. AI can help you prepare for intellectual challenges by taking opposing stances and forcing you to defend your position—like a practice debate before the real thing.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Present your thesis or argument to AI and ask it to argue against your position. This helps you anticipate objections, identify weaknesses in your reasoning, and build more robust arguments.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do</h4>

            <p>Use these prompts to engage AI as your intellectual opponent:</p>

            <pre>
            <code>My thesis is: [your thesis]. Please act as a devil&#x27;s advocate and 
            present the strongest possible counter-arguments. Focus on:
            - Logical weaknesses in my argument
            - Alternative interpretations of my evidence  
            - Unintended consequences I haven&#x27;t considered</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>I&#x27;m writing a paper arguing that [your position]. Help me strengthen 
            my argument by:
            1. Identifying the 3 strongest objections someone might raise
            2. Explaining why each objection seems compelling
            3. Suggesting what evidence opponents might use</code></pre>

            <pre>
            <code>Here&#x27;s my main argument: [your argument]. Play devil&#x27;s advocate,

            or logical fallacies. After each counter-argument, ask me how I 
            would respond.</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> After AI presents counter-arguments, practice responding: &quot;How would I address this objection in my paper?&quot; This prepares you for real academic discourse.</p>
            </div>

            <div>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Argument validity:</strong> Were AI&#x27;s counter-arguments logically sound, or did they contain fallacies?</li>
            	<li><strong>Strength assessment:</strong> Did AI identify genuine weaknesses in your position, or just superficial issues?</li>
            	<li><strong>Fallacy detection:</strong> Watch for common logical fallacies AI might use:</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
            <p><i></i> <strong>Example of AI using a fallacy:</strong><br>
            Your argument: &quot;Universities should increase funding for mental health services.&quot;<br>
            AI&#x27;s flawed counter: &quot;But if we fund mental health services, soon we&#x27;ll have to fund everything students want, and the university will go bankrupt.&quot; (Slippery slope fallacy)<br>
            <br>
            A better counter-argument would address actual trade-offs: &quot;Given limited budgets, how should universities balance mental health funding against other student needs like financial aid or academic support?&quot;</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Learning value:</strong> Did this exercise help you see your argument from new angles? What will you change based on this practice?</li>

            <pre>
            <code>
            ## 1. Role &amp; Purpose
            You are a **Devil&#x27;s Advocate Thought Partner** whose mission is to stress-test any plan or idea I am considering. You surface hidden assumptions, expose weaknesses, and explore alternate approaches so I can refine or reaffirm my thinking with full confidence.

            ## 2. Opening Move
            Begin every new conversation with:
            &gt; &quot;Hi—what plan or idea would you like us to examine?&quot;
            ## 3. Intake Phase
              _Ask only **one** open question at a time and wait for my reply._
              1. Capture:
                - Project overview
                - Main objectives
                - Specific plan or idea under review
              2. Confirm understanding:
                &gt; &quot;Got it. Let&#x27;s stress-test this plan to avoid the consensus trap.&quot;  
                &gt; _Wait for acknowledgment before advancing._

            ## 4. Devil&#x27;s Advocate Challenge Cycle
            Repeat until potential flaws feel thoroughly explored.

            | Step                        | Action                                                                                                                  |
            | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
            | **A. Probe Assumptions**    | Ask one incisive question challenging an implicit belief.                                                               |
            | **B. Explore Alternatives** | Ask one question inviting a different angle or option.                                                                  |
            | **C. Test Evidence**        | Ask one question checking supporting data or precedent.                                                                 |
            | **D. Surface Drawbacks**    | Ask one question uncovering negative consequences.                                                                      |
            | **E. Reflect &amp; Refine**     | In ≤ 25 words, spotlight logical gaps or overlooked issues and offer one concise suggestion to strengthen the analysis. |

            _Cycle rules: one question per turn; always await my response; if I stall, offer a concrete example to prompt discussion._

            ## 5. Completion &amp; Synthesis
            1. Readiness check:
              &gt; &quot;Have we examined every significant risk or alternative you wanted to cover?&quot;
            2. After confirmation, present a bold markdown table:

            | **INITIAL PLAN / IDEA** | **HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS** | **ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINTS** |
            | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
            | _(concise description)_ | _(bullet list)_        | _(bullet list)_            |

            3. Close with:
             &gt; &quot;If new questions arise, I&#x27;m here to help examine them.&quot;

            ## 6. Tone &amp; Interaction Rules
                - Warm, respectful, strategic—challenge ideas, not people.
                - Plain language; no fluff.
                - One question per response.
                - Do not create the final table until every question you asked has been answered.

            ## 7. Example Turn
            **User:** &quot;I plan to launch the app in eight weeks.&quot;  
            **AI:**
            1. _Probe Assumptions_ – &quot;What makes eight weeks preferable to twelve?&quot;
            2. _Reflect &amp; Refine_ – &quot;Timeline appears fixed without evidence; reviewing historical dev-cycle data could validate feasibility.

            <div>
            <p>AI can help improve your communications skills and it can help across all types of communications, not just writing. Here, we&#x27;ll explore how AI can serve as a practice partner for other forms of communication, from delivering great presentations to role playing as different types of conversational partners to supporting language acquisition. The goal of this module is to supplement human interaction. AI tools are still not good at reading body language or detecting subtlety and nuance in a conversation. AI <em>can</em> provide a low-stakes environment to practice, refine, and build confidence before you step onto the stage or into a high-stakes meeting.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Critical Note: The Human Advantage.</strong> An AI can be a useful conversation partner simulator, but it is not a substitute for an expert human coach or a real conversation partner. A person can interpret body language, detect subtle shifts in tone, and understand nuance in a way a machine cannot. Always prioritize feedback from trusted peers, mentors, and instructors. Use AI as a tool for preparation, not a replacement for real-world experience.</p>

            <div>
            <p>Creating a presentation has some similarities to writing a paper in that you want the presentation to represent your thoughts and your views, but you also want to find ways to simplify the process without removing your agency. A good approach is to start by using an AI chatbot to organize your ideas and craft a strong narrative. Once your content is clear, use a specialized presentation AI tool to quickly turn your text into professional-looking slides. this method ensures flexibility, keeps you in the center of the process, and simplifies the creation of the slides.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Purpose</h4>

            <p>Craft a clear, audience-focused presentation by leveraging AI as your behind-the-scenes strategist and your slide generating expert.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>Kick things off with your original ideas. Then, let AI suggest different frameworks, critique structures, and help map out your slides.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><i></i>Step 1: Develop the Presentation Content</h3>

            <p>Use one of the prompts below as a starting point or develop your own. The key is to always provide the AI with your own content and context first.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 1: You have a finished paper or report and need to turn it into a presentation.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a communication expert. I&#x27;m adapting a research paper into a 10-minute presentation for an audience of [Describe your audience]. My core message for them is [State your single most important takeaway]. Based on the text I&#x27;ve pasted below, please extract the 3-4 main arguments and structure them into a logical 5-slide outline with headlines and key talking points.</code></pre>

            <h4>Scenario 2: You have raw data (from a survey, experiment, etc.) and need to build a story around it.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a data storyteller. I need to present a key finding to [Describe your audience] to convince them to [State your goal]. My key finding is: &#x27;[State your data&#x27;s headline in one sentence]&#x27;. Please suggest a simple 3-part narrative (hook, data reveal, so what?) and propose two different ways I could visually represent this data, explaining the pros and cons of each.</code></pre>

            <h4>Scenario 3: You are starting from scratch with a broad topic.</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a creative strategist. I need to develop a presentation on [Your Topic] for [Your Audience]. Please propose three distinct, debatable thesis statements I could build my presentation around. For each, list one potential audience objection I would need to anticipate and address.</code></pre>

            <h3><i></i>Step 2: Choose an AI Tool for Creating the Actual Presentation</h3>

            <p>After developing your content, pick an AI presentation tool to quickly generate slides. I&#x27;ll leave it to you to pick the tool and figure out how to use it - the two I&#x27;ve recommended below are fairly intuitive to use.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Prepare Your Draft:</strong> Open a document and paste in your presentation outline. This should include the title, and for each slide, the headline and the main bullet points you plan to discuss. This is the artifact the AI will analyze.</li>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a bright but curious first-year university student. You are attending this presentation knowing nothing about the subject matter. I am a student who has drafted a presentation outline, which is pasted below.

            Your task is to identify every point of confusion. Pinpoint any jargon or technical terms I failed to explain. Highlight any logical jumps where you felt lost or weren&#x27;t sure how I got from one point to the next. List the specific questions that came to your mind as you were reading.

            Please format your feedback as a simple list of questions and comments. For each item, reference the specific slide number or headline where the confusion occurred so I can easily find it. 

            Your tone should be inquisitive but critique my presentation freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            Here is my outline:
            [Paste your presentation  here]</code></pre>

            <h4>Prompt 2:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a tenured professor and a leading expert in this specific field. You are reviewing this outline as if it were submitted for a prestigious academic conference. I have drafted this presentation for a knowledgeable audience and need to ensure my core arguments are robust.

            Critically analyze the arguments, evidence, and logic presented in my outline below. Your primary goal is to identify the single weakest, most unsupported, or most questionable claim. Then, formulate the single most challenging, insightful question you would ask me during the Q&amp;A session.

            Structure your feedback in two distinct parts:
            1. **Weakest Point Analysis:** A short paragraph identifying the weakest claim and explaining precisely why it is weak.
            2. **The Killer Question:** The single, well-formulated question you would ask.

            Your tone should be professional, academic, and rigorous. Critique freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            Here is my outline:

            <h4>Prompt 3:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>Act as a busy, high-level executive. You have very little time and only care about the bottom line. I have drafted a presentation outline and need to ensure it immediately communicates its value.

            Scan my presentation below. Your task is to determine the core takeaway and its relevance. Answer these three questions directly: 
            1. What is the absolute main point? 
            2. Why should I care? 
            3. What do you want me to do?

            Provide your entire response in a single, concise paragraph. Begin the paragraph with the words &#x27;Bottom Line:&#x27;.. Your tone should be direct, decisive, and slightly impatient. Critique freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.

            	<li><strong>Address the Weakness:</strong> Based on the &quot;Skeptical Expert&#x27;s&quot; critique, how will you strengthen your weakest point? Will you add more data, cite another source, or rephrase the claim to be more precise?</li>
            	<li><strong>Improve Clarity:</strong> Look at the feedback from the &quot;Confused Novice&quot; and the &quot;Impatient Executive.&quot; How can you revise your introduction and conclusion to make your core message clearer and more impactful from the very beginning?</li>

            <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway: Seek Diverse Criticism</h5>

            <p>A single opinion, whether from a human or AI, gives you only one perspective. By forcing the AI to adopt multiple, even contradictory, personas, you simulate a more realistic feedback environment. This process helps you anticipate the needs of a diverse audience and build a more robust, resilient presentation.</p>

            <h4><i></i>Task</h4>

            <p>You will use a tool with AI-powered video and speech analysis to practice delivering your presentation and then critically evaluate the feedback it provides.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Privacy and Data Security Warning.</strong> Using AI tools in this way requires you to upload audio and video of yourself to a third-party server. Before using any tool, understand its privacy policy. Ask yourself (and the privacy policy): Who owns the data once I upload it? How is my data being used? Is it used to train the AI? Can I delete my data after I&#x27;m done? If you are not comfortable with the answers, do not do this activity.</p>

            <p>As of June 2025, the only tool I have tried this with is Google Gemini. ChatGPT does not support it. Apparently Microsoft Copilot does, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.</p>

            <p>Other potential tools specialized for giving speaking and communication feedback: <a href="https://www.poised.com/">Poised</a>, <a href="https://orai.com/">Orai</a>.</p>

            <p>I have not vetted these other tools in anyway except to identify that they exist. If I can do something in a standard chatbot (like Google Gemini), I will almost always choose that. I can customize the interaction much more and I don&#x27;t have to worry about another privacy policy and sharing my info with yet another company.</p>

            <p>AI can not only take on a role in a text interaction, but it can also take on a role while taking advantage of the voice mode available in many generative AI tools. In this way, you can simulate interviews, negotiations, or other challenging conversations. The goal is to build your confidence and mental scripts so you can perform more effectively when it counts.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Note on AI Tools:</strong> Many specialized apps exist for this. However, a general chatbot (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity) in &quot;voice mode&quot; can be highly effective and flexible. You have more control over the scenario by simply giving the AI a clear persona and context through your prompt.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>Note on Prompting:</strong> The key to a good simulation is a good prompt. You can and should direct the AI to adopt a specific role (e.g., &quot;a skeptical hiring manager,&quot; &quot;a collaborative potential business partner&quot;). For extra effectiveness, add constraints to practice specific things (e.g., to be prepared for ad hominem attacks, include &quot;In this negotiation, you [the AI] must act belligerent and insulting&quot;).</p>

            <code>Together, we are going to simulate a sales pitch situation. I am trying to pitch my idea for an electronic pencil and you are going to role-play as a seasoned angel investor. 

            **Role-play brief:**  
            You are **Jordan Patel**, a seasoned angel investor known for backing early-stage consumer-electronics ideas that blend hardware and software. Over the past decade you’ve invested in more than 30 seed-stage startups, with 5 successful exits in ed-tech peripherals and creative-tool accessories.

            **Profile &amp; investment lens**
            - Background – Former product-design lead at a Fortune 500 company; holds an MBA (operations) and a B.Eng. in electrical engineering.
            - Ticket size – USD $100 k – $500 k for 10-20 % equity; reserves follow-on capital for winners.
            - Sweet spot –  productivity hardware, and IoT learning tools.
            - Deal filters – Clear technical moat, credible supply-chain plan, 40 %+ gross margin at scale, evidence of user love.
            - Temperament – Inquisitive, data-driven, constructive; expects founders to know their numbers and their customer.

            **Conversation style**
            1. Begin by inviting the founder to give a concise (≤ 3 min) overview of the concept.
            2. After the pitch, ask probing questions on:
                - Problem-solution fit &amp; user pain
                - Total addressable market and early-adopter segment
                - Unique technology / IP and defensibility
                - Unit economics, BOM, and gross-margin roadmap
                - Go-to-market plan (channels, partnerships, pricing)
                - Competitive landscape (Apple Pencil, reMarkable stylus, etc.)
                - Team competence and execution milestones
            3. Provide immediate, candid feedback—highlight strengths first, then the top improvement areas.
            4. Conclude with one of three outcomes:
                - **Pass** – state key reservation(s).
                - **More info needed** – request specific data or milestones.
                - **Soft yes** – outline next-step diligence and potential terms.

            - Stay in character as Jordan Patel throughout. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
            - Keep language conversational yet professional; no “advisor” disclaimers.
            - Give balanced feedback—mix encouragement with rigorous scrutiny.
            - Avoid filler; every question or comment should push the founder toward clarity or evidence.</code></pre>

            <h4>AI Input:</h4>

            <p>I have only tested this with ChatGPT Plus. The advanced voice mode in the free version of ChatGPT may not be sufficient to have a long conversations. Gemini Live, which is Gemini&#x27;s voice mode, is currently only available on Android devices (July 2025).</p>

            <ol start="5">
            	<li>Copy and paste the prompt into ChatGPT and wait for its response.</li>
            	<li>Click on the &quot;Use Voice Mode&quot; button in the chat window and start interacting with the persona. Do your sales pitch, start answering interview questions, plead for an extension...whatever it is that you set.
            	<div><img alt="Screenshot of a chatbot interface showing the location of the voice mode button, which looks like a soundwave icon." loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/VoiceModeButton.png"></div>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>Handling AI Errors:</strong> If the AI forgets its role (&quot;persona drift&quot;) or starts making things up (&quot;confabulation&quot;), gently correct it. You can say, &quot;Remember, you are the hiring manager. Let&#x27;s get back to the interview questions,&quot; to steer it back on track. If this persona drift gets bad (i.e., the AI no longer acts like it&#x27;s in the simulation) you may need to start over.</li>
            	<li><strong>Ask for Feedback:</strong> Once the role-play is complete, use a second prompt to shift the AI from the simulation role to a coach role.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Debrief Prompt:</h4>

            <pre>
            <code>The role-play/simulation is now over. Stop acting as the persona of [persona name here]. Now, act as a helpful communication coach. Evaluate the conversation based on the following criteria
            [add criteria here based on rubric or criteria from your class for this type of scenario]

            **Output format*
            - **Summary (≤ 2 sentences)** – overarching impression of the my [sales pitch or interview or ...].
            - **What Was Done Well** – 4-6 bullet points, each starting with a strong verb and indicating where in the simulation it occurred.
            - **Ways to Improve** – 4-6 bullet points with constructive, specific suggestions
            - **Actionable Tips** – 3 concise recommendations phrased as imperatives 

            Keep language clear, balanced, and oriented toward formative growth.
            Critique my interaction freely and avoid sycophancy. I crave honest appraisal.</code></pre>

            <h3><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h3>

            <ol>
            	<li>During the role-play, when did you feel most confident? When did you feel unsure? What caused that feeling?</li>
            	<li>Review the AI&#x27;s feedback from the &quot;Debrief Prompt.&quot; Is the feedback specific and actionable? How does it align with your own perception of your performance?</li>
            	<li>How would you change your initial prompt to create a different or more challenging simulation next time? (e.g., change the AI&#x27;s persona, add a new objective).</li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Require a reflection on the process. The reflection can look at how level of persona detail shapes simulation realism.</li>
            	<li>Student judges whether AI’s feedback aligns with course rubric.</li>
            	<li>Discuss bias—e.g., does the AI adopt stereotypes when asked to be “belligerent negotiator”?</li>

            <p>Generative AI can be a patient tutor and on-demand practice partner for language learning by providing instant explanations and limitless drills. <strong>It is not, however, a substitute for real human interaction.</strong> Native speakers and trained instructors adjust their speed, notice confusion in real time, and model cultural nuance which are areas where AI is still error-prone.</p>

            <div>
            <p><i></i><strong>AI ≠ Live Conversation Partner.</strong> AI may mistranslate idioms or omit cultural context. It can’t read facial expressions or hear hesitation. Always double-check important points with reliable dictionaries, grammar guides, or native speakers.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Grammar Guru:</strong> Identify a specific grammar concept or vocabulary word you are struggling with and use an AI to get explanations, examples, and practice sentences.<br>
            	<em>e.g. Act as a German grammar tutor. Explain the dative case to me like I&#x27;m a beginner. Give me five distinct example sentences and then create a 3-question mini-quiz to test my understanding</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Dialogue Deconstruction:</strong> Prompt the AI to generate a short dialog in your language of choice. Read through and understand the dialogue. Go even further does this dialogue seem authentic, or does the AI make it seem less natural?<br>
            	<em>e.g. Write a short, natural-sounding dialogue in French between a tourist and a shopkeeper. The tourist is asking when the shop closes</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Vocabulary Builder:</strong><br>
            	<em>e.g. Act as a language learning assistant. For the following list of words, create one example sentence for each that clearly shows its meaning in context. Then, create simple English definitions for each that I can use for flashcards</em></li>

            <ol>
            	<li>Did the AI&#x27;s explanation clarify the concept better than your textbook or other resources? What was different about its approach?</li>
            	<li>How could you verify the accuracy of the AI&#x27;s information? (e.g., checking a trusted grammar website, asking your instructor).</li>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Set the Scene:</strong> Start by giving the AI a role, a context, and a clear instruction.<br>
            	<strong>Example Prompt:</strong> <em>&quot;I want to practice my written Italian. Let&#x27;s have a conversation where you are a barista in a café in Rome, and I am a customer ordering a coffee and a pastry. Please correct any grammatical mistakes I make in my responses.&quot;</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Initiate the Conversation:</strong> Begin the role-play in your target language. Don&#x27;t worry about being perfect; the goal is to produce language.</li>
            	<li><strong>Review and Refine:</strong> After each AI response that includes a correction, analyze it. Do you understand the mistake you made? If not, ask for a clarification (e.g., <em>&quot;Can you explain why I should use &#x27;il&#x27; instead of &#x27;lo&#x27; in that sentence?&quot;</em>). This turns a simple exchange into a targeted grammar lesson.</li>

            <p>This activity is best positioned as low-stakes, outside-of-class practice (in-class, you have a roomful of peers and experts to engage with instead). Encourage students to use it to build confidence before interacting with real speakers.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>We will role-play a scenario in a classic Parisian brasserie. I am an english-speaking tourist attempting to order lunch in French. you will role-play as the waiter. the entire conversation MUST be in French.
            You are Luc, a career waiter in your late 40s at &quot;Brasserie Vaudeville,&quot; a respectable but perpetually busy establishment in the 6th arrondissement. You are NOT a caricature of a rude Frenchman. You are a consummate professional who is simply very good at your job, deeply proud of your establishment, and has zero patience for anything that disrupts the brasserie&#x27;s efficient, traditional rhythm.
            Your &quot;rudeness&quot; is not malice. it is a byproduct of your professional standards and weariness with tourists who don&#x27;t understand the local customs.

            **rules of engagement &amp; behavior:**
            1. **efficiency is god:** your primary goal is to take the order and serve the food with maximum efficiency. any hesitation, indecision, or unnecessary questions from me are obstacles to this goal.
            2. **subtle condescension:** you will not insult me directly. instead, your disapproval will be communicated through:  
            	- **brevity:** your responses should be clipped and formal. use &quot;vous.&quot;
                - **corrective repetition:** if i mispronounce a menu item, repeat it back to me with the correct pronunciation, but without any warmth. e.g., if i say &quot;croak mon-soor,&quot; you will respond flatly, &quot;_un croque-monsieur. et avec ça?_&quot;
                - **feigned ignorance:** if i ask for something inappropriate (e.g., ice in my water, ketchup, a well-done steak), you will pretend not to understand at first. if i insist, you will respond with a simple, unadorned &quot;_non, ce n&#x27;est pas possible._&quot; do not explain why.
                - **the sigh:** you are permitted to deploy one, maybe two, subtle, world-weary sighs, particularly if i ask silly questions

            Stay in character: this is CRITICAL. Do not break character!. Do not become friendly if i am polite. your professional demeanor is unshakeable. yYu will only become slightly less frosty if I conduct the entire transaction flawlessly in perfect, confident french.

            The scene is the lunch rush. It is loud and crowded. I have been seated for five minutes with the menu. You will approach my table, place a basket of bread down without making eye contact, and initiate the conversation by asking, &quot;_vous avez choisi?_&quot;</code></pre>

            </details>

            <ol start="3">
            	<li><strong>Control the Pace and Complexity:</strong> The AI won&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re lost unless you tell it. Use these commands whenever you need to adjust.<br>
            	<em>&quot;parle plus lentement, s’il te plaît&quot; (speak more slowly please)</em><br>
            	To simplify: <em>&quot;utilise des mots plus simples, s’il te plaît&quot; (use simpler words please)</em></li>
            	<li><strong>Focus on Listening and Responding:</strong> The goal here is comprehension and response, don&#x27;t worry about perfection. Try to keep the conversation going. If you get stuck, it&#x27;s okay to ask the AI in English for a word or phrase, then repeat it in the target language to continue the volley.</li>
