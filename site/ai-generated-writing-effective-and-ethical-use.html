<h2><i></i>Introduction</h2>

<div>
<p><strong><i></i>Your First and Most Important Step: Check Your Course Policy</strong></p>

<p>Before using any idea from this module for an assignment, you must understand your instructor&#x27;s specific AI policy. Seriously. Print it out. Write it on your hand. Set it as your phone wallpaper. Violating the policy doesn&#x27;t just risk academic consequences—it undermines the very reason you&#x27;re here: to learn. This module shows you what&#x27;s possible with AI, but your instructor&#x27;s guidelines are the final word on what&#x27;s permissible.</p>
</div>

<p>Just like learning, writing is hard. Like, &quot;staring at a blank page for three hours while eating your body weight in snacks&quot; hard. But it&#x27;s supposed to be. That struggle is your brain doing the work. While AI can generate flawless-looking text in seconds, it skips the most important part: the mental workout. The real value of writing isn&#x27;t just the finished text; it&#x27;s the thinking you do to get there.</p>

<p>Writing is how you:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Solidify what you think:</strong> It forces you to organize the chaos in your brain into a coherent argument.</li>
	<li><strong>Express who you are:</strong> It gives a platform to your unique experiences, insights, and voice.</li>
	<li><strong>Build a crucial life skill:</strong> Thinking and communicating clearly is a superpower you&#x27;ll need long after you graduate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news? Writing gets easier (or at least less painful) when you make it purposeful. </p>

<h2>How Your Instructor Might Approach AI:</h2>

<p>Your instructor&#x27;s policy will likely fall into one of these three broad categories, though the specific details will vary. That&#x27;s why reading the exact policy on your syllabus is so important.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>&quot;No AI Allowed&quot;</strong><br>
	Honor this stance. Your instructor has good reasons: ensuring you do the thinking, exercising your writing muscles, and developing your authentic voice. Think of it as intellectual cross-fit—painful but building essential strength. You&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunities to use AI in other contexts.</li>
	<li><strong>&quot;Limited AI Use&quot;</strong><br>
	If your instructor allows specific uses, make the most of them and put some thought into how best to use AI:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Use good prompting to explore ideas (not generate them for you).</li>
		<li><strong>Editing Feedback:</strong> Input course materials, rubrics, and assignment details to get targeted suggestions.</li>
		<li><strong>Revision Support:</strong> Get specific feedback on clarity, structure, or style—but do the rewriting yourself.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>&quot;AI as a Collaborative Tool&quot;</strong><br>
	Some instructors encourage using AI to generate initial drafts that you then critically evaluate and revise, or to review your writing and reflect on the feedback. This approach treats AI as a thinking partner, not a substitute for thinking.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of the level of AI work you are permitted to use, the goal of this module isn&#x27;t to help you avoid the hard work of writing. It&#x27;s to show you how to use AI to make that hard work more productive, insightful, and even fun. Let&#x27;s get started.</p>

<h2><i></i>The Core of Ethical AI Use: The Contribution Statement</h2>

<p>Before you even open an AI tool, you need a plan for transparency. When you use generative AI to support you with a project or assignment, your goal is to use it as a legitimate tool while also documenting its use. An AI contribution statement is a simple, ethical way to document your process for your instructor and for yourself. It helps turn AI use from a secret into a scholarly practice.</p>

<p>While not always mandatory in your class, documenting your AI use is a powerful habit that:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Maintains your intellectual integrity</strong> in an AI-saturated world.</li>
	<li><strong>Documents your learning process,</strong> creating a record of how you developed your ideas.</li>
	<li><strong>Prepares you for an emerging professional standard</strong> in many fields.</li>
	<li><strong>Makes you accountable to yourself</strong> by helping you find the line between your contribution and what the AI did.</li>
</ul>

<h4> </h4>

<div>
<p><strong><i></i>Follow Your Instructor&#x27;s Lead.</strong> The best method for documentation depends on the scope of your project and might be specified by your instructor. If you don&#x27;t have a specific documentation model to follow, the two models below are good, adaptable starting points.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>[CONCEPTUAL GRAPHIC: Model A (Checklist) vs. Model B (Flowchart)]</p>
</div>

<h3><i></i>Model A: The Structured Statement</h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Essays, research papers, lab reports, or any single-document assignment where AI was used for specific, distinct tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Based on the work of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00986283241259750" target="_blank">Albada &amp; Woods (2025)</a> and <a href="https://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/26548/34482" target="_blank">Weaver (2024)</a> this model is a concise, point-by-point summary of each interaction with an AI tool. You create a new entry for each significant use.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Template &amp; Examples</h4>

<p>For each significant use, document the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Tool &amp; Date:</strong> The AI tool used and the date of use.</li>
	<li><strong>Task/Purpose:</strong> What you asked the AI to do.</li>
	<li><strong>Prompt(s) Used:</strong> The specific prompt you gave the AI.</li>
	<li><strong>Integration &amp; Oversight:</strong> How you evaluated, adapted, and incorporated the AI&#x27;s output into your work.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p><strong>Example 1 (Narrative Style):</strong></p>

<p><em>“In writing this research proposal, I used Chatbot GPT, on December 9th, to help me with understanding the conceptual definitions and differences between research ethics and research integrity. It started with the following prompt: ‘Write a 300-word piece about the difference between research ethics and research integrity.’ Then I used other similar prompts to help me better understand these two constructs. The generated text was not copied verbatim and included in my Research Proposal; it was paraphrased and included in the Overall Introduction. I further used academic citations and other readings that I have done to assist with my paraphrasing.”</em></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Example 2 (Structured Style):</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1. Tool &amp; Date:</strong> Perplexity, Oct 26, 2025</li>
	<li><strong>2. Task/Purpose:</strong> To summarize a complex academic source to ensure I understood its main argument.</li>
	<li><strong>3. Prompt(s) Used:</strong> &quot;Summarize the main arguments and methodology of the attached article: [article_file.pdf]&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>4. Integration &amp; Oversight:</strong> I compared Perplexity&#x27;s summary to my own reading of the article to verify its accuracy. The summary helped clarify the author&#x27;s position on... I then used this clarified understanding to formulate my own critique in the second paragraph of my literature review, citing the original source directly.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><i></i>Model B: The Process Narrative</h3>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Capstone projects, portfolios, design projects, or any work where AI is integrated throughout a long-term creative process.</p>

<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Instead of logging every single prompt, you write a narrative that describes the overall role AI played in your workflow. This approach focuses on the <em>process</em> and your strategic decisions, demonstrating how you directed the AI as a tool to achieve your project goals.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> For a real-world model, you can read the detailed Process Narrative outlining how this very AI Literacy website was built using AI as a strategic partner:</p>

<p><a href="ai-contribution-statement.html" target="_blank"><strong>See the AI Contribution Statement for This Website <i></i></strong></a></p>

<div>
<h5><i></i>The Bottom Line</h5>

<p>An AI Contribution Statement is a declaration of your own intellectual honesty and confidence. It demonstrates that you are in control of your tools and are proud of the work—and thinking—that you have contributed. Ultimately, it&#x27;s a tool for self-reflection that helps you answer the only question that truly matters: <strong>At the end of the day, whose thinking is on the page?</strong></p>

<h1><i></i>AI for Brainstorming &amp; Structuring Ideas</h1>

<div><img alt="Blueprint morphing into building" loading="lazy" src="https://d1qywhc7l90rsa.cloudfront.net/accounts/165495/images/blueprint_to_building1.png"></div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Pre-writing (e.g., brainstorming, free-writing, clustering, and outlining) transforms a vague topic into a workable blueprint. Done well, it identifies hidden angles and ideas, spots weak links early, and saves drafting time later. AI can act as an always-on collaborator, offering fresh perspectives and fast categorization without stealing your voice. The activities that follow combine hands-on exercises with targeted prompts so you stay in control while the machine handles the heavy lifting.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Task</h4>

<p>Create a rich bank of ideas on a topic, beginning with a solo brain-dump and then inviting AI to widen the lens without drowning your ideas. We&#x27;ll pick an arbitrary example of a topic for this exercise: <em>Cultural-Studies essay on “Food and Identity in Immigrant Communities”</em></p>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do it</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Three minute brain dump</strong>: Write nonstop for three minutes every notion, phrase, or story that pops up (e.g., grandma’s recipes, fusion restaurants, nostalgia, language on menus). No editing.</li>
	<li><strong>Skim your brain dump</strong> and identify related items (e.g., economics, gender roles).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get Some AI Input</strong></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Put the topics into an AI tool and ask it to categorize the ideas. See if it gets the same results as you.
	<pre>
<code>Act as a cultural-studies brainstorming partner. For this list of ideas on the topic of Food and Identity in Immigrant Communities:
[add list here]
Identify common themes and split the ideas into categories.</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>Compare your categories to the AI generated categories and then determine which you are going to keep.</li>
	<li>Ask the AI to add two fresh angles or ideas per category plus one wildcard idea that doesn&#x27;t fit any category.
	<pre>
<code>Act as a cultural-studies brainstorm partner. For each category below, list two new angles or ideas (≤15 words each) that we have not already discussed. Then suggest one wildcard angle unrelated to any category.
Categories: [list categories here]</code></pre>

	<p><em>Note: As long as you are having this conversation in the same thread in the generative AI chatbot, it will have all of the ideas discussed in its context, so you don&#x27;t have to list them again.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>From the full list of discussion angles and ideas, star the ones that feel surprising or exciting; strike anything bland or off-topic. Aim to keep 8-10 ideas and angles total.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause and Ponder</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ownership check</strong>: Count starred ideas: at least half should be yours. If AI dominates, return to Phase 1 and dig deeper from personal experience or readings.</li>
	<li><strong>Breadth vs. Depth</strong>: Do the starred angles cover multiple dimensions (history, sociology, personal narrative)? If all sit in one lane, revisit Phase 3 and request angles for missing dimensions.</li>
	<li><strong>Feasibility scan</strong>: Pick two starred angles and spend 5 minutes searching your library database: can you locate at least one quality source for each? If not, swap them out.</li>
	<li><strong>Spark test</strong>: Read the final list aloud. Which angle makes you want to keep talking? That spark often signals the best starting point for drafting.</li>

<h4><i></i>Task</h4>

<p>Turn a broad course theme into a sharp, research-ready question blending your own brainstorming via the QFT with a short burst of AI amplification. We&#x27;ll pick an arbitrary example: <em>Participation in Canadian federal elections by young voters is consistently much less than participation by older voters.</em></p>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do it</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Write down a factual, neutral statement on your topic.</li>
	<li>Spend 4 minutes and ask as many questions as you can about this statement. Don&#x27;t judge, don&#x27;t provide answers, these should be questions not statements. Aim for 10-12 how/why/what questions.</li>
	<li>Mark each question O (open-ended) or C (closed-ended). As an exercise, convert 2 O→C and 2 C→O.</li>
	<li>Star three questions that feel answerable, interesting, and aligned with the assignment scope.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get Some AI Input</strong></p>

<ol start="5">
	<li>Ask an AI tool to deepen each starred question with follow-ups.
	<pre>

• 3 political science theories that could frame my analysis
• 3 places I could find supporting data (organisations, datasets or keyword phrases)</code></pre>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Novelty check</strong>: Did any AI-generated angle surprise you? If every follow-up felt predictable, revisit the AI tool and push for riskier questions.</li>
	<li><strong>Feasibility test</strong>: For the refined thesis question, can you identify at least two peer-reviewed sources within 10 minutes of searching? If not, narrow or redirect.</li>
	<li><strong>Ownership audit</strong>: Highlight in one colour the words that are entirely yours and in another the phrases inspired by AI. Your final wording should lean heavily toward the first colour.</li>
	<li><strong>Alignment scan</strong>: Ensure your question matches the assignment’s required focus (e.g., causal analysis vs. policy proposal).</li>

<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do it</h4>

<p><strong>Drafting the Thesis</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Write</strong> a provisional thesis (≤30 words).</li>

	<li><strong>Prompt the AI</strong> with the revised thesis:

	<pre>
<code>Here is my thesis: &quot;&lt;your revised thesis&gt;&quot;

Identify THREE persuasive counterarguments that an informed critic might raise.
For EACH counterargument, include ONE concise piece of evidence (e.g., a statistic, study, or report title + year) the critic could cite.

<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Adjust the thesis using any AI score below 3 as a revision target.</li>
	<li>Decide which counterargument is most dangerous to your claim.</li>
	<li><strong>Handle the &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;</strong>: AI excels at identifying the most common, predictable counterarguments. Use this to your advantage.

Treat every factual claim from an AI as a lead, not a fact. Your next step is to go to your library&#x27;s databases to find the <em>actual</em> study, report, or quote. Never cite a source provided by an AI without first locating and reading it yourself.</p>

<h1><i></i>Drafting Support: Brain-Driven Prose, AI-Assisted Polish</h1>

<div>
<div>
<p>When pre-writing, you drew the blueprint by crafting a thesis, outline, and audience profile. Now you&#x27;ll build the prose, leaning on GenAI as a writing coach but not as your ghost-writer.</p>

<p>Drafting is where the temptation to outsource your thinking is the strongest. The activities here are designed to help you resist that temptation, keeping you in creative and critical control. You will use AI <em>only</em> for targeted feedback, option-generation, and diagnostic checks on text <em>you have already written</em>. Exercise your brain; build those neural paths so that critical thinking becomes easier and more natural. Then get AI feedback to reveal blind spots and help you polish your prose.</p>

<p>Every activity in this section is built on a three-step workflow. This process ensures you are always doing the heavy intellectual lifting.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>The Core Workflow: Your Three-Step Process</h5>

<p><strong>1. Brain First ➜</strong> You create the raw material. This means writing the initial clunky sentence, the underdeveloped paragraph, or the full first draft. The thinking and the words originate with you.</p>

<p><strong>2. AI for Options ➜</strong> You take your self-generated text to the AI. You prompt it to act as a coach, an editor, or a strategist—requesting <em>feedback</em>, <em>analysis</em>, or <em>alternative options</em> (phrasing, structure, examples), never the final answer.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Never paste copyrighted or private data into public models.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>3. Use Your Judgement ➜</strong> You critically evaluate the AI&#x27;s output. You are the final authority. You accept, reject, or modify the suggestions based on your own judgment, voice, and argumentative goals.</p>

<div>
<p>New MIT research shows that when students use LLMs for writing, they experience reduced brain connectivity, lower satisfaction, and impaired ownership of their ideas. The convenience of using an LLM comes with genuine cognitive costs. We&#x27;re not saying avoid AI; we are saying that if you do the intellectual heavy lifting first, then use AI strategically for feedback and refinement, you&#x27;ll build your brain AND be more proud of the end result.</p>

<details><summary><i></i><span>Activity 1: The Accordion Method - Strong Paragraphs</span></summary>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To write a fully developed and substantiated paragraph starting with a single topic sentence from your outline.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Write out a complete paragraph that provides evidence, analysis, and significance for your main point. Then, use targeted AI feedback to identify and strengthen the paragraph&#x27;s weakest link.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong> This is where you do the real work of drafting. Your goal is to build a complete paragraph from a single idea.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Start with your Point:</strong> Write down one topic sentence from your outline.</li>
	<li><strong>Add your Evidence:</strong> Write a sentence that introduces a piece of evidence (a fact, quote, or data point) to support that point.</li>
	<li><strong>Provide your Analysis:</strong> Write 2+ sentences explaining what the evidence <em>means</em> and how it proves your point.</li>
	<li><strong>State the Significance:</strong> Write a final sentence that connects the entire paragraph back to your paper&#x27;s main thesis. Why does this point matter?</li>
</ol>

<p>You have now drafted a complete paragraph entirely on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Now, use the AI as a quality auditor. The prompt below asks the AI to diagnose potential weaknesses and asks you a question about it. It is not intended to rewrite anything for you.</p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a writing coach. I have drafted a paragraph using the Point -&gt; Evidence -&gt; Analysis -&gt; Significance structure.

My paragraph:
&quot;[Paste your full, self-written paragraph here]&quot;

Your task is to:
1. Identify the weakest part of my paragraph (Is the analysis too shallow? Is the evidence not clearly connected to the point? Is the significance unclear?).
2. Ask me specific, probing questions that will force me to think more deeply about how to strengthen that single part. Do not rewrite any part of my paragraph.</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Do you agree with the AI&#x27;s diagnosis? Why do you think it identified <em>that specific part</em> of your paragraph as the weakest?</li>
	<li>Take a moment to answer the AI&#x27;s question in your own words. How did answering it help you see a gap in your original draft?</li>
	<li>Based on your answer, revise your original paragraph. What specific changes did you make to the evidence, analysis, or significance to make the paragraph stronger?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Notes for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Model the Process:</strong> Before students try this, model it live. Start with a topic sentence and &quot;think aloud&quot; as you write the evidence, analysis, and significant sentences.</li>
	<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Coaching:</strong> For an AI-free version, have students swap paragraphs and perform the AI&#x27;s role: identify the weakest part and ask one probing question.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on the &quot;Why&quot;:</strong> The most valuable part of this exercise is the student&#x27;s answer to the AI&#x27;s question. Assess their ability to reflect on and deepen their own analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Connect to Outlining:</strong> Reinforce that a clear, focused topic sentence (from their outline) makes the entire accordion expansion process dramatically easier and more effective.</li>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To practice diagnosing and revising your own sentences for clarity and impact, using AI-generated alternatives as a catalyst for your own editorial decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Identify a weak sentence in your draft, diagnose its problem, and use AI-generated options to help you craft a more precise and powerful version.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Find a sentence from your draft that feels clunky, awkward, or unclear.</li>
	<li>In one sentence, diagnose the problem. What makes it weak? (e.g., &quot;The verb is passive,&quot; &quot;It tries to do too much at once,&quot; &quot;The meaning is ambiguous.&quot;)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Use the prompt below to get targeted feedback. By providing your own diagnosis in the prompt, you give the AI better context to act as your coach.</p>

<pre>
<code>Act as my writing center tutor. My goal is to improve the clarity and impact of a sentence from my draft.

My clunky sentence:
&quot;[Paste your sentence here]&quot;

My diagnosis of the problem:
&quot;[Paste your one-sentence diagnosis here]&quot;

Based on my diagnosis, provide:
1. several distinct, revised versions of my sentence.
2. For each version, add a one-sentence explanation of the specific editorial strategy you used (e.g., &quot;This version uses a stronger verb,&quot; &quot;This version splits the complex idea into two sentences,&quot; &quot;This version leads with the main clause for more directness&quot;).</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Which of the AI&#x27;s suggested strategies most directly solves the problem you diagnosed in the &quot;Brain First&quot; step?</li>
	<li>What specific change (e.g., a different word, moving a clause) had the biggest positive impact on the sentence&#x27;s clarity? Why was it so effective?</li>
	<li>Read your final, revised sentence aloud. How does it sound more like <em>you</em> than any of the raw AI options?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Notes for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Model it Live:</strong> Project a clunky sentence, diagnose it aloud, consult the AI, and talk through your final editorial choice to make your expert thinking visible.</li>
	<li><strong>Use a &quot;Sentence Swap&quot;:</strong> Have students diagnose a partner&#x27;s sentence <em>before</em> using the AI. This builds their analytical skills on unfamiliar text.</li>
	<li><strong>Assess the &quot;Why&quot;:</strong> Ask students to submit a one-sentence justification for their final choice. The quality of their reasoning is the true measure of learning.</li>
	<li><strong>Encourage Remixing:</strong> Challenge students to &quot;remix&quot; the AI&#x27;s options—taking a verb from one and a structure from another—to reinforce their role as the final author.</li>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To transform abstract, general claims into powerful, persuasive arguments by substantiating them with specific, concrete details and evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Identify vague sentences in your draft and use AI-generated questions to help you unearth the specific details needed to make your writing more vivid and credible.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Find a sentence in your draft that makes a general claim or uses abstract language that isn&#x27;t supported by specific proof. (e.g., &quot;The policy had a negative impact,&quot; or &quot;The character experienced significant growth.&quot;)</li>
	<li>Before using the AI, <strong>analyze the claim</strong>.
	<ul>
		<li>What type of claim is this? (e.g., A claim of fact/value/cause&amp;effect)</li>
		<li>What type of evidence would my audience need to be convinced? (a statistic, a direct quote, a concrete example, an illustrative anecdote)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Now, challenge your own thinking. Use the prompt below to have the AI act as a curious reader who needs more information to be convinced.</p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a skeptical but curious reader. I want to make a general claim from my draft more specific and convincing.

My general claim is:
&quot;[Paste your abstract sentence here]&quot;

Your task is to ask me three probing questions that would force me to provide more concrete, sensory, or factual details. Frame your questions to start with phrases like:
- &quot;What does that look like specifically?&quot;
- &quot;Can you give me a direct example of...?&quot;
- &quot;How could a reader see or measure that...?&quot;
- &quot;Who exactly was affected and how?&quot;

Do not suggest any answers or rewrites. Only ask the questions.</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Look at the AI&#x27;s questions. How did they push you to think more specifically about the <em>type</em> of evidence your argument required?</li>
	<li>Answer the AI&#x27;s questions using your own knowledge or research. Now, rewrite your original sentence incorporating these new, specific details.</li>
	<li>Read your &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; sentences. How does the revised, more specific version change the reader&#x27;s experience and the credibility of your argument?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Note for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Model the Process:</strong> Project a vague sentence from a sample text. Ask the class for probing questions before using the AI to show that this is a human-first critical thinking skill.</li>
	<li><strong>Create a Before and After Gallery:</strong> In a shared document, have students post their &quot;before&quot; (vague) and &quot;after&quot; (vivid) sentences. This creates a powerful visual bank of examples.</li>
	<li><strong>Peer Review Role-Play:</strong> Have students swap vague sentences and act as the &quot;skeptical reader&quot; for their partner, asking the probing questions themselves. (This is a miniature version of the PAIRR Framework where students peer review each others papers and have an AI do a review as well).</li>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To adjust the tone of your writing to meet the specific needs of your audience, without sacrificing your authentic authorial voice.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Analyze a paragraph for tone, use an AI to suggest targeted word changes based on your audience persona, and make deliberate editorial choices to improve a match.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Select one or more paragraphs from your draft (you could use the whole draft if you want).</li>
	<li>Review the audience persona you developed in the Pre-writing section or create one if you haven&#x27;t already. Then answer these questions:
	<ul>
		<li>What does my audience value? (e.g., clear data, directness, creative thinking, efficiency, respect for tradition)</li>
		<li>What impression do I want my writing to convey? (seem knowledgeable and objective, innovative and passionate, or respectful and cautious)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Re-read your paragraph through the lens of your answers. Pinpoint 2-3 points where your writing fails to align with your audience&#x27;s values or the impression you want to make.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Use the prompt below. Including your own analysis and the persona gives the AI the specific context it needs to provide high-quality feedback.</p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a rhetorical coach. My goal is to align the tone of my paragraph with my target audience.

My Audience Persona:
&quot;[Paste your audience persona here]&quot;

My Audience&#x27;s Core Values: &quot;[List the values you identified in step 2]&quot;
The Impression I Want to Convey: &quot;[State the impression you identified in step 2]&quot;

My initial analysis identified these specific mismatches: 
[List the 2-3 parts you identified]

Based on this, provide:
1. A three-column table (Original | Proposed | Rationale) with 5-7 suggested word or phrase swaps that would make the tone more effective for my audience.
2. In the second column, alongside the suggestion, add a brief justification that explains *why* the new word is a better fit for the persona (e.g., &quot;replaces a casual idiom with a more formal term,&quot; &quot;uses a verb with a more analytical connotation&quot;).</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>How did the AI&#x27;s suggestions compare to the words you initially identified? Did it confirm your instincts or reveal a blind spot in your self-analysis?</li>
	<li>Select one AI suggestion you are <strong>rejecting</strong>. What specific nuance, meaning, or part of your authentic voice would be lost if you accepted that change?</li>
	<li>After making your revisions, what is the single most important lesson you learned about writing for this specific audience?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Note for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Audience Guessing Game:</strong> Have students review a partner&#x27;s &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; paragraphs and try to guess the intended audience persona. A misidentification is a great learning moment about tone.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on Rejection:</strong> Ask students to share one AI suggestion they <em>rejected</em> and their reason why. This highlights their critical judgment and authorial control.</li>
	<li><strong>Build a &quot;Tone Lexicon&quot;:</strong> Create a class document where students add effective word swaps they discovered for different tones (e.g., Formal, Persuasive, Skeptical).</li>
	<li><strong>Connect to Pre-writing:</strong> This activity directly demonstrates the practical value of the &quot;Audience-Persona Mirror&quot; activity, showing students how planning pays off in revision.</li>

<details><summary><i></i><span>Activity 5: The Bridge Builder - Paragraph Transitions</span></summary>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To craft clear and logical transitions that guide your reader smoothly from one idea to the next, reinforcing the overall coherence of your argument.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Analyze the logical link between two paragraphs, use an AI to generate options for executing that link, and select or craft a transition that best serves your argument.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Select two adjacent paragraphs from your draft.</li>
	<li>For each paragraph, write a single sentence that states its main point or claim.</li>
	<li>Now, write one sentence that describes the <strong>logical relationship</strong> between those two points. (e.g., &quot;Paragraph 2 provides a specific example of the general claim in Paragraph 1,&quot; or &quot;Paragraph 2 presents a counterargument to the idea in Paragraph 1.&quot;)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Use the prompt below. Providing your analysis of the relationship is the key to getting high-quality, relevant suggestions from your AI coach.</p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a writing coach specializing in argument structure. My goal is to create a strong transition between two paragraphs.

Main Point of Paragraph 1:
&quot;[Paste the main point of your first paragraph]&quot;

Main Point of Paragraph 2:

My analysis of the logical relationship:
&quot;[Paste your sentence describing the relationship]&quot;

Based on my analysis, provide:
1. Several distinct transition sentences or phrases that effectively signal this logical relationship to the reader.
2. For each option, label the primary rhetorical move it uses (e.g., Cause &amp; Effect, Elaboration, Concession, Comparison).</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Compare the rhetorical moves suggested by the AI to your own initial analysis. Did the AI offer a more precise or effective way to frame the relationship you identified?</li>
	<li>Why is the transition you ultimately chose the most effective for guiding your reader? What specific signal does it send them about the information that is about to come?</li>
	<li>Read the two paragraphs with your new transition aloud. How does it improve the overall flow and logic of your argument?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Note for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rhetorical Move Sort:</strong> Before the activity, give students a list of common transition words (&quot;Therefore,&quot; &quot;However,&quot; &quot;In addition,&quot; &quot;Similarly&quot;) and have them sort them into categories by function.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on the &quot;Relationship Sentence&quot;:</strong> The sentence students write in the &quot;Brain First&quot; step is the most important part of the exercise. Use it as a diagnostic tool to see if they understand their own argument&#x27;s structure.</li>
	<li><strong>Make Thinking Visible:</strong> Have students highlight their final transition sentence in their draft and add a comment explaining the rhetorical move they chose and why.</li>
	<li><strong>Peer Review the Flow:</strong> In pairs, have students read each other&#x27;s two paragraphs (with the new transition) and describe the logical journey the writer took them on.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To draft an engaging introduction that sets up your argument and a memorable conclusion that reinforces your main takeaway, ensuring your paper starts strong and finishes with impact.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Draft your full introduction or conclusion, then use a structured AI analysis to evaluate its core components and guide your revision.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Write a complete, full-paragraph draft of the introduction/conclusion. This is your raw material, built entirely from your own thinking.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong> Select the prompt that matches the paragraph you wrote. This provides the AI with a clear rubric to act as your structural coach.</p>

<p><em>Introduction Prompt:</em></p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a writing instructor evaluating the introduction of a paper.

My draft introduction:
&quot;[Paste your full introduction paragraph here]&quot;

Your task is to analyze my draft based on the three core jobs of an introduction:
1.  **The Hook:** Quote the sentence(s) you believe act as the hook. Is it effective at grabbing the reader&#x27;s attention?
2.  **The Context:** Briefly describe the context my introduction provides. Is it sufficient for a reader to understand the topic?
3.  **The Thesis:** Quote the sentence you believe is my thesis statement. Is it clear, specific, and arguable?</code></pre>

<p><em>Conclusion Prompt:</em></p>

<pre>
<code>Act as a writing instructor evaluating the conclusion of a paper.

My draft conclusion:
&quot;[Paste your full conclusion paragraph here]&quot;

Your task is to analyze my draft based on the three core jobs of a conclusion:
1.  **The Synthesis:** Does the paragraph briefly synthesize the paper&#x27;s main points (without just listing them)?
2.  **The &quot;So What?&quot;:** Identify the sentence(s) that explain the broader significance, implications, or importance of my argument.
3.  **The Final Thought:** Does the paragraph offer a memorable final thought that leaves a lasting impression?</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Review the AI&#x27;s analysis. If it struggled to identify one of the core components (like your thesis or your &quot;so what?&quot; statement), what does that tell you about the clarity of your writing?</li>
	<li>The AI identified a specific element as the weakest. Do you agree with this diagnosis? Why or why not?</li>
	<li>Based on this feedback, what are the revisions you will make to your introduction and conclusion to make them more effective?</li>
</ol>

<h1><i></i>Using AI for Revising, Editing, and Proofreading</h1>

<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Revising:</strong> Revision is RE-VISION, i.e., looking at your draft again. During revision, you focus on things like your arguments, evidence and purpose and not on nitty-gritty details like commas and word choice. In this stage of writing, you are confirming that the foundation of your paper is solid.</p>

<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Argument:</strong> Is my thesis clear and compelling? Is it consistently supported throughout the paper?</li>
	<li><strong>Audience:</strong> Will this draft meet the expectations of my intended readers (e.g., my professor, my classmates)?</li>
	<li><strong>Structure &amp; Flow:</strong> Does my argument progress logically? Are the paragraphs in the right order?</li>
</ul>

<p>For a deeper dive, see the UNC Writing Center&#x27;s guide on <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/revising-drafts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Revising Drafts</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Editing:</strong> Editing is refining; it&#x27;s where you focus on how you express your ideas, ensuring your language is clear, effective, and polished.</p>

<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Clarity &amp; Style:</strong> Are my sentences easy to understand? Is my tone appropriate for my audience?</li>
	<li><strong>Paragraphs:</strong> Does each paragraph have a clear topic sentence? Is there a good balance of evidence and my own analysis?</li>
	<li><strong>Flow:</strong> Are the transitions between sentences and paragraphs smooth?</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Proofreading is polishing the final details. It involves hunting for errors and typos that can distract your reader and undermine your credibility.</p>

<p><strong>Look for:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Grammar &amp; Punctuation Errors</li>
	<li>Spelling Mistakes</li>
	<li>Formatting Issues (e.g., citations, page numbers)</li>
	<li>Typos</li>
</ul>

<p>Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, Lex and many others are excellent tools to support your revising, editing, and proofreading processes - as long as you don&#x27;t let them do all the work. Remember: use your brain first, apply AI tools next, then use your own judgement in creating the final product. If you&#x27;ve reached this stage you should have been using your brain a lot to create your first draft. To effectively integrate AI into your revising, editing, and proofreading process, here is a suggested workflow:</p>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Recommended Workflow</h5>

<p>Using AI to enhance your Revising -&gt; Editing -&gt; Proofreading without replacing your own intellectual effort.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Use your brain first: <a href="ai-generated-writing-effective-and-ethical-use.html" target="_blank">Complete Your Draft</a>.</strong> Write the entire paper using your own thinking. Get your ideas down without worrying about perfection.</li>
	<li><strong>Revise with AI as a Structural Analyst.</strong> Use AI for the big picture. <strong>Focus:</strong> purpose, argument, audience, structure.</li>
	<li><strong>Edit with AI as a Style Coach.</strong> Once the structure is solid, focus on how the ideas are expressed. <strong>Focus:</strong> clarity, tone, sentence variety, paragraph coherence and organization.</li>
	<li><strong>Proofread with AI as a Detail-Checker.</strong> Use tools for the final polish. <strong>Focus:</strong> grammar, spelling.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h5><i></i>Important Tips</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Get feedback from the AI, but make the edits yourself. This will help you understand and identify patterns in your writing that can be improved.</li>
	<li>Evaluate all AI suggestions against the intended message, your own voice, and common sense. Pay special attention to factual errors, depth, nuance, authenticity, and bias.</li>
	<li>Put another human in the loop and seek peer/instructor/expert feedback.</li>
	<li>Always perform a final, human read-through to catch errors the AI missed and ensure the voice is yours.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2><i></i>Activities</h2>

<p>For each of the revising and editing activities, I strongly recommend following the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000088#sec0024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PAIRR framework</a> for getting peer feedback (download the Word doc in the Appendix of the PAIRR paper. Supplementary materials section), AI feedback and then comparing the two. If you cannot get peer feedback, then you do the revising and editing activities yourself and compare to what the AI gives you.</p>

Please provide clear, detailed, specific, and supportive feedback. The format for your feedback should be as follows: 1. Two to three positive aspects of my paper and why those aspects are effective. 2. Three to four aspects for revision and the reasoning about why each poses an issue, and 3. A suggestion for revising each one.

<h2><i></i>Revision Activities</h2>

<p>Revision is where you step back from the sentence-level and look at the big picture: your argument&#x27;s logic, structure, and flow. The activities below treat AI as a <strong>structural analyst</strong>. You&#x27;ll use it to get a &quot;second look&quot; at your paper&#x27;s skeleton, helping you spot logical gaps, strengthen your thesis, and ensure your ideas connect seamlessly.</p>

<div>
<details><summary><i></i><span>Revision Activity 1: The Reverse Outline</span></summary>

<div>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To analyze the logical flow and structural integrity of your draft by creating an outline from your finished text. This helps you see if your argument progresses logically or if it jumps around unexpectedly.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> You will create a reverse outline of your draft using your own analytical skills, then ask AI to perform the same task. By comparing the two outlines, you&#x27;ll discover whether you and the AI see the same structural strengths and weaknesses in your paper.</p>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Dive-in &amp; Do It</h4>

<p><strong>Use your brain first:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Follow these instructions for <a href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/reverseoutlines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creating a reverse outline</a> from your draft.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Get AI Input:</strong></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Use the following prompt to have AI create its own reverse outline.</li>
</ol>

<pre>
<code>You are an _academic writing coach_ with experience teaching university writing courses. Please review my full draft (pasted below) and build a **reverse outline**.

The purpose of a reverse outline is to help determine if the paper meets its goals, discover places where you might need to expand evidence or analysis, and identify where readers might struggle with your organization or structure.

A reverse outline extracts the main claim of each paragraph so the writer can inspect logic, structure, and flow **after** drafting.

Here are the steps for creating a reverse outline:
1. Read through the entire draft to understand the thesis and overall arc
2. For each body paragraph: identify its core idea -&gt; this is sentence &#x27;a&#x27;; and identify its rhetorical job -&gt; this is sentence &#x27;b&#x27;
3. Number the sentences 1a, 1b, 2a etc. 
4. Review the numbered list to analyze the paper&#x27;s logical flow and structure and create a Structural Observations commentary where you note the strengthes, flag gaps or redundancies and suggest fixes.

Formatting:
- Keep each (a)/(b) sentence ≤ 30 words.
- Keep the **Structural Observations** section ≤ 200 words.

Here is my draft:

</div>

<div>
<h4><i></i>Pause &amp; Ponder</h4>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Compare the outlines:</strong> How similar are your reverse outline and the AI&#x27;s version? Where do they differ significantly? What does this reveal about how you and the AI &quot;read&quot; your paper differently?</li>
	<li><strong>Reverse Outline Questions to ask of yourself and of the AI:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>What do you see as the paper&#x27;s overall argument based on this outline?</li>
		<li>Which paragraphs seem most closely connected to each other?</li>
		<li>Are there any paragraphs that seem disconnected from the main argument?</li>
		<li>Do you notice any repetitive points or gaps in the logical flow?</li>
		<li>Where might a reader have trouble following the progression of ideas?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Revision decisions:</strong> Based on the two outlines, what are the structural changes you will make to strengthen your paper?</li>

<h5><i></i>Notes for Instructors</h5>

<p>If you want to adapt this activity in your class, here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Side-by-Side Prompt Demo:</strong> Show a weak, overly broad prompt next to a well-crafted CRAFT prompt. Run both through the AI so students can see the stark difference in feedback quality.</li>
	<li><strong>Prompt Draft → Peer Debug:</strong> Let students exchange their first-draft prompts and “debug” each other’s wording for clarity, specificity, and ethical boundaries before ever consulting the AI.</li>
	<li><strong>Quick Fire Revisions:</strong> Set a timer (e.g., 5 minutes) for students to refine their prompt after seeing the AI’s first response. This models iterative design and keeps the session energetic.</li>
	<li><strong>Ethics Checkpoint:</strong> Require students to add one line in their prompt specifying what the AI should not do (e.g., “Do not rewrite my paragraphs for me”). This reinforces responsible use.</li>
	<li><strong>Mini-Reflection Exit Ticket:</strong> End class with a sticky-note or LMS post: “One insight I gained about prompt engineering today is ______.” Use these to gauge understanding and plan follow-ups.</li>
	<li>Use the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000088" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PAIRR Framework</a> with the student&#x27;s drafts and the revision prompt students craft.</li>

<h2><i></i>Proofreading</h2>

<p>If we stick with our initial definition of proofreading (Grammar &amp; Punctuation Errors, Spelling Mistakes, Formatting Issues, Typos), it&#x27;s clear that proofreading is mostly a mechanical, rules-based activity. In most cases, using an AI tool to do these checks is acceptable, even in classes where using AI is strictly prohibited. In fact, it is difficult to <em>avoid</em> using an AI tool to do these checks. If you are working in MS Word, you are going to get grammar and spelling suggestions automatically and these are driven by AI. That being said, a final proofread by a human is always necessary to catch those things that AI still misses.</p>

<p>Word processors like Word and Google Docs have built-in proofreading but there are many other AI tools that are designed for proofreading (and editing). Two of the most popular are Grammarly and Quillbot, but there are many others. The other tool worth mentioning is <a href="https://www.turnitin.ca/products/features/draft-coach/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Draft Coach from Turnitin</a> which is available to Okanagan College students through our institutional license (as of June 2025). Draft Coach is built-in to your online version of Microsoft 365 when you login with your OC credentials. It helps you with citations, grammar, and avoiding plagiarism.</p>

<p>Personally, for proofreading, I prefer to rely on the built-in tools in Microsoft for the basic stuff, chatbots with targeted prompts for a more detailed check, and then doing a final check with my own eyes. It makes the process intentional and I can prompt for specific things with each (grammar, vocabulary enrichment, verb tense consistency, passive vs. active voice). The main downside is that this an extra step that requires cutting and pasting whereas tools like Grammarly are built right into the text editor.</p>

<div>
<p>Your proofreading process is up to you, but remember that for every new tool that you use, you are sharing your personal information and your work with another company. I know that people rarely do this, but read the privacy policy and data agreement to understand what the company is going to do with your data and work. </p>
</div>

<p>Based on my own limited experience and the online consensus here is a quick overview of the suggested proofreading tools (for a quick but more comprehensive summary, ask Perplexity Deep Research to compare these tools):</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Draft Coach</strong> is your best choice to support academic writing and it is available for free as long as OC maintains the institutional license. Draft Coach has strong citation tools, gives you a chance to check your own work for plagiarism, corrects grammar mistakes and provides explanations to guide your proofreading.</li>
	<li><strong>Grammarly</strong> is the most comprehensive proofreading solution. It has better accuracy and detailed error explanations.</li>
	<li><strong>Quillbot</strong> is a solid alternative to Grammarly but focuses more on paraphrasing.</li>
	<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is the most flexible, but requires good prompting since it is not specifically an editing or proofreading tool.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<details><summary><i></i><span>Proofreading Activity 1: Compare the Tools</span></summary>

<p><strong>Use Your Brain First:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Read through the paragraphs below and see if you can find the spelling and grammar errors and make suggestions for improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<code>The principal designer argued that the principle concern was aesthetic cohesion, not cost overruns. At the budget meeting, however, finance officers insisted that sticking to first principals required cutting the lighting plan, leaving the principal’s proposal in jeopardy.

Dr. Singh finally met with Rivera after reviewing the performance data, and she decided the pilot needed another month. She also recommended that the team document every iteration before presenting it to the board.

Glancing quickly through the microscope, the bacterial colonies appeared to morph into translucent threads that the research assistant could barely count.

The new onboarding manual asks interns to (a) log their hours, (b) complete safety training, and that they submit a weekly reflection journal to HR by Friday.

Only one of the project milestones were completed on schedule, yet management announced that the results “exceeded expectations” in the quarterly report.

The engineers finished the stress analysis earlier than expected the marketing team, meanwhile, had already printed the brochures with outdated specifications.

During the interview, the CEO explained that the company’s guiding mantra is “build what matters to the customer, test it relentlessly, and scale responsibly.

To synergize our outreach stack, we should parallel-process the empathy touchpoints while hard-pivoting into a data-literate mindset; that way the vibe stays premium but also low-latency for key stakeholders.</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<code>At yesterday’s kickoff meeting, the lead architect argued that energy efficiency, not superficial aesthetics, ought to steer every major decision in the greenhouse build. He predicts that a roof-mounted heat-exchange loop could trim utility costs by nearly forty percent without sacrificing crop yield, and added that the design would compliment the surrounding orchard.

After the city inspector spoke with Dr. Reyes about the ventilation blueprint, she requested a revised drawing that clarified the airflow differentials. Walking through the half-finished frame, the LED grow lights looked far too bright for seedlings. The project charter promises to reduce waste, improving neighborhood engagement, and to create seasonal teaching modules for local schools.

None of the preliminary safety tests was conclusive, but the team declares that the system “operates flawlessly” in internal memos. Volunteers assembled the seed racks before dawn the installation crew, however, arrived after lunch and had to reposition every tray. During a radio interview, the project lead explained that the guiding slogan is “grow local, learn global, and share endlessly. To hyper-optimize our community-facing deliverables, we must granularly gamify the outreach funnels so the stakeholders feel maximum uplift vibes.</code></pre>
