            <h2><i></i>The Core of Ethical AI Use: The Contribution Statement</h2>
            <p>Before you even open an AI tool, you need a plan for transparency. When you use generative AI to support you with a project or assignment, your goal is to use it as a legitimate tool while also documenting its use. An AI contribution statement is a simple, ethical way to document your process for your instructor and for yourself. It helps turn AI use from a secret into a scholarly practice.</p>

            <p>While not always mandatory in your class, documenting your AI use is a powerful habit that:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Maintains your intellectual integrity</strong> in an AI-saturated world.</li>
            	<li><strong>Documents your learning process,</strong> creating a record of how you developed your ideas.</li>
            	<li><strong>Prepares you for an emerging professional standard</strong> in many fields.</li>
            	<li><strong>Makes you accountable to yourself</strong> by helping you find the line between your contribution and what the AI did.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4> </h4>

            <div>
            <p><strong><i></i>Follow Your Instructor&#x27;s Lead.</strong> The best method for documentation depends on the scope of your project and might be specified by your instructor. If you don&#x27;t have a specific documentation model to follow, the two models below are good, adaptable starting points.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
            <p>[CONCEPTUAL GRAPHIC: Model A (Checklist) vs. Model B (Flowchart)]</p>
            </div>

            <h3><i></i>Model A: The Structured Statement</h3>

            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Essays, research papers, lab reports, or any single-document assignment where AI was used for specific, distinct tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Based on the work of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00986283241259750" target="_blank">Albada &amp; Woods (2025)</a> and <a href="https://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/26548/34482" target="_blank">Weaver (2024)</a> this model is a concise, point-by-point summary of each interaction with an AI tool. You create a new entry for each significant use.</p>

            <div>
            <h4><i></i>Template &amp; Examples</h4>

            <p>For each significant use, document the following:</p>

            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Tool &amp; Date:</strong> The AI tool used and the date of use.</li>
            	<li><strong>Task/Purpose:</strong> What you asked the AI to do.</li>
            	<li><strong>Prompt(s) Used:</strong> The specific prompt you gave the AI.</li>
            	<li><strong>Integration &amp; Oversight:</strong> How you evaluated, adapted, and incorporated the AI&#x27;s output into your work.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <p><strong>Example 1 (Narrative Style):</strong></p>

            <p><em>“In writing this research proposal, I used Chatbot GPT, on December 9th, to help me with understanding the conceptual definitions and differences between research ethics and research integrity. It started with the following prompt: ‘Write a 300-word piece about the difference between research ethics and research integrity.’ Then I used other similar prompts to help me better understand these two constructs. The generated text was not copied verbatim and included in my Research Proposal; it was paraphrased and included in the Overall Introduction. I further used academic citations and other readings that I have done to assist with my paraphrasing.”</em></p>

            <hr>
            <p><strong>Example 2 (Structured Style):</strong></p>

            <ul>
            	<li><strong>1. Tool &amp; Date:</strong> Perplexity, Oct 26, 2025</li>
            	<li><strong>2. Task/Purpose:</strong> To summarize a complex academic source to ensure I understood its main argument.</li>
            	<li><strong>3. Prompt(s) Used:</strong> &quot;Summarize the main arguments and methodology of the attached article: [article_file.pdf]&quot;</li>
            	<li><strong>4. Integration &amp; Oversight:</strong> I compared Perplexity&#x27;s summary to my own reading of the article to verify its accuracy. The summary helped clarify the author&#x27;s position on... I then used this clarified understanding to formulate my own critique in the second paragraph of my literature review, citing the original source directly.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3><i></i>Model B: The Process Narrative</h3>

            <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Capstone projects, portfolios, design projects, or any work where AI is integrated throughout a long-term creative process.</p>

            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Instead of logging every single prompt, you write a narrative that describes the overall role AI played in your workflow. This approach focuses on the <em>process</em> and your strategic decisions, demonstrating how you directed the AI as a tool to achieve your project goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a real-world model, you can read the detailed Process Narrative outlining how this very AI Literacy website was built using AI as a strategic partner:</p>

            <p><a href="ai-contribution-statement.html" target="_blank"><strong>See the AI Contribution Statement for This Website <i></i></strong></a></p>

            <div>
            <h5><i></i>The Bottom Line</h5>

            <p>An AI Contribution Statement is a declaration of your own intellectual honesty and confidence. It demonstrates that you are in control of your tools and are proud of the work—and thinking—that you have contributed. Ultimately, it&#x27;s a tool for self-reflection that helps you answer the only question that truly matters: <strong>At the end of the day, whose thinking is on the page?</strong></p>
