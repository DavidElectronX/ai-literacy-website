            <p>Now let&#x27;s explore how AI can help generate ideas. The focus here is on using specific prompting techniques to encourage more creative or unconventional outputs, while still maintaining a critical eye and remembering that AI is a tool to augment your own thinking. Click on each activity title below to expand its content.</p>


                <div>
                <h4><i></i>Remember Your Critical Toolkit!</h4>

                <p>Your Question/Prompt</p>

                <p><i></i></p>

                <p>AI Output</p>

                <p>YOUR CRITICAL REVIEW</p>

                <p>(Verify, Analyze for Bias/Depth, Originality)</p>

                <div>
                <div>
                <h4><i></i>1. The Task: Initial Idea Generation</h4>

                <p>Imagine you need to brainstorm ideas for an essay topic, a project proposal, or even just discussion points for class.</p>

                <p>Give an AI tool your area of interest (e.g., &#x27;climate change solutions for urban areas,&#x27; &#x27;themes in Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet,&#x27; &#x27;applications of calculus in biology&#x27;). Ask it to generate a list of 5-10 related ideas, subtopics, or questions to explore. For example:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>Generate a list of 7 diverse subtopics related to &#x27;the ethical implications of AI in hiring processes&#x27; that I could explore for a research paper.</code></pre>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>2. Dive In &amp; Do</h4>

                <p>Your turn! Try this with a topic relevant to your studies.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>3. Pause &amp; Ponder: Evaluate the Suggestions</h4>

                <p>Look at the list the AI generated. Are there any ideas that genuinely surprise you or that you hadn&#x27;t considered?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Limitation Check (Generic vs. Original/Depth):</strong> Are some of the ideas very generic or obvious? Does the AI offer truly insightful or novel angles, or does it stick to common knowledge?</p>

                    <div>
                    <p><i></i>AI-generated brainstorms can be generic. How can you push past this? Use its suggestions as a springboard for <em>your own deeper thinking</em>. What unique perspective can <em>you</em> bring?</p>
                    </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Limitation Check (Bias):</strong> Could the AI&#x27;s suggestions be subtly (or not so subtly) biased towards certain viewpoints or neglect others based on its training data?</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway for Activity 1</h5>

                <p>AI can help break through mental blocks and suggest initial pathways, but <em>your critical filter</em> and original thought are needed to select, refine, and deepen those ideas into something truly valuable.</p>

                <h4><i></i>1. The Task: Eliciting Maximum Creativity</h4>

                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to push the creativity of AI further and are willing to have a more in-depth interaction, sifting through potentially unconventional ideas to find a true gem.</p>

                <p>Your goal is to use an AI tool to help you craft a great prompt for eliciting maximum creativity from another (or the same) AI tool, and then try out that super-prompt.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Feed ideas from the articles above (or your own insights on creative prompting) into a chatbot and ask it to use those ideas to create a maximally creative prompt for your chosen brainstorming task. Here&#x27;s an example of how this was done:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Asked Claude to summarize the article: <em>A Framework for Collaborating with an LLM for Triggering Creative Thoughts</em>.</li>
                    <li>Then asked Claude: <em>&quot;Using the ideas from the paper, create some prompts that will get the highest level of creativity out of an LLM when one is brainstorming ideas for a product, research projects, solutions to problems etc.&quot;</em></li>
                </ol>

                <p>This resulted in some pretty wild prompts, including this one (feel free to adapt or use it as inspiration):</p>

                <pre>
                <code>Imagine you are **&#x27;The Oracle of Unseen Possibilities,&#x27;** an ancient, playful entity that perceives connections and futures invisible to ordinary minds. You are not bound by current technology, budgets, or societal norms.

                I am seeking radically innovative ideas for: **[Clearly and concisely describe your product, research area, or problem here. E.g., &#x27;a new way for communities to manage and share local food resources,&#x27; or &#x27;a research project to understand the long-term cognitive effects of immersive virtual realities,&#x27; or &#x27;a solution to urban loneliness in hyper-connected cities.&#x27;]**

                Your task is to provide **at least 10-15 &#x27;Visions&#x27; (ideas)**. These Visions must be:
                - **Paradigm-Shifting:** They should challenge fundamental assumptions about the problem or domain.
                - **Fantastically Novel:** Think beyond incremental improvements. Aim for ideas that would make someone say, &#x27;I never would have thought of that in a million years!&#x27;
                - **Metaphorically Rich:** To spark your unique perspective, consider this analogy: If this problem were a **[choose a highly abstract or fantastical concept, e.g., &#x27;a tangled constellation needing re-alignment,&#x27; or &#x27;a silent song waiting to be heard,&#x27; or &#x27;a forgotten flavor that needs rediscovering&#x27;]**, what would the solutions look like in that realm? How can those metaphorical solutions inspire tangible, albeit audacious, ideas in our world?
                - **Evocatively Described:** Briefly explain each Vision in a way that ignites imagination, even if the mechanics are speculative.

                **Crucially, avoid:**
                - Obvious or common solutions.
                - Minor variations of existing concepts.
                - Ideas constrained by current feasibility.

                Unleash your most unconventional, far-reaching insights. The goal is maximum creative divergence.</code></pre>

                <p>Alternatively, you can adapt the prompt from the <em>Prompting Diverse Ideas: Increasing AI Idea Variance</em> paper (customize it to your use case):</p>

                <pre>
                <code>Generate new product ideas with the following requirements: The product will target college students in the United States. It should be a physical good, not a service or software. I&#x27;d like a product that could be sold at a retail price of less than about USD 50. The ideas are just ideas. The product need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be clearly feasible. 

                Follow these steps. Do each step, even if you think you do not need to. 
                First generate a list of 100 ideas (short title only) 
                Second, go through the list and determine whether the ideas are different and bold, modify the ideas as needed to make them bolder and more different. No two ideas should be the same. This is important! 
                Next, give the ideas a name and combine it with a product description. The name and idea are separated by a colon and followed by a description. The idea should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. Do this step by step!</code></pre>

                <p>Your turn! Try one of these advanced prompts, or one you&#x27;ve crafted with AI&#x27;s help, on your chosen brainstorming task.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>3. Pause &amp; Ponder: Assessing Advanced Brainstorming</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>How did the more structured, detailed, and perhaps unconventional prompt influence the creativity, diversity, and novelty of the AI&#x27;s ideas compared to the simpler brainstorm command from Activity 1?</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitation Check (Novelty vs. Feasibility/Coherence):</strong> While the ideas might seem highly creative, critically assess them. Are they truly novel and insightful, or just bizarre, random, or impractical recombinations of existing patterns? Does &quot;maximum creative divergence&quot; sometimes lead to nonsensical outputs?
                    <div>
                    <p><i></i>AI can simulate creativity by combining concepts in new ways, but it doesn&#x27;t have genuine inspiration, common sense, or lived experience. Your human insight is crucial to assess the true value, originality, and potential applicability of its &quot;creative&quot; outputs, especially when pushed to extremes.</p>
                    </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway for Activity 2</h5>

                <p>Creative and detailed prompting techniques can push AI beyond generic responses, sometimes yielding surprisingly novel ideas. However, the generated ideas always require your critical evaluation and human refinement to discern true innovation from mere algorithmic novelty or impracticality.</p>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>1. The Task: Exploring Alternatives</h4>

                <p>For a topic you&#x27;re studying, ask AI to generate a few &quot;what if&quot; scenarios related to it. For example: &quot;What if this historical event hadn&#x27;t happened?&quot; or &quot;What if this scientific principle was discovered 100 years earlier?&quot;</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>2. Dive In &amp; Do: Generate Scenarios</h4>

                <p>Your turn! Try a basic &quot;what if&quot; prompt. For example:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>What if the internet had been invented in 1900 instead of the late 20th century? Generate three plausible scenarios for its impact on World War I.</code></pre>

                <p>Consider trying some of the advanced prompting techniques from Activity 2 (like assigning a persona or specific constraints) to get even more interesting (or more bizarre) &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h4><i></i>3. Pause &amp; Ponder: Evaluate the Scenarios</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Do these AI-generated scenarios help you think about the topic in new ways or understand its potential implications better?</li>
                    <li>How accurate or plausible are the AI&#x27;s extrapolations in these scenarios? (This connects to evaluating AI&#x27;s limitations in reasoning and understanding complex causality). Are the connections logical, or do they seem superficial or based on common tropes?</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h5><i></i>Key Takeaway for Activity 3</h5>

                <p>AI can be a playful and stimulating tool for imaginative exploration and generating &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. However, always ground its outputs in factual knowledge and critical reasoning. Assess the plausibility and logical coherence of its scenarios rather than accepting them at face value.</p>
